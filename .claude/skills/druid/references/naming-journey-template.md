# Druid — Naming Journey Template

## Purpose

The naming scratchpad documents the thinking process when finding a Grove-themed name for a new animal skill. Save these to `docs/scratch/{concept}-naming-journey.md`. They become part of Grove's story.

# Naming Journey: [Concept]

## What Is This Thing?

**Fundamentally:**
- Is it a place? An object? A process? A creature?

**What does it DO?**
- [Primary action/purpose]

**What emotion should it evoke?**
- [Target feeling: patient, swift, methodical, playful, curious, sharp...]

## Walking Through the Forest

I enter the grove. I see the animals already here...
[Bloodhound tracking scents through the underbrush]
[Elephant building with steady momentum]
[Bee buzzing from flower to flower]

I need something that [does X]. Where do I find it?

I walk past the [existing animals]...
I see a clearing where [new animal] should be.
It would be a [type] that [action].

## Candidates

"[Name] is what you call when _______________."

## Selection: [Name]

[Reason for final choice — be honest about what clicked]

```

## Example Completed Journey

```markdown
# Naming Journey: Code Reviewer

## What Is This Thing?

**Fundamentally:** A creature that examines code carefully and leaves thoughtful comments.

**What does it DO?**
Reviews pull requests: finds issues, acknowledges good patterns, provides actionable feedback.

**What emotion should it evoke?**
Sharp but fair. Observant. A little intimidating but ultimately helpful.

## Walking Through the Forest

I enter the grove. Bloodhound tracks through underbrush, Elephant builds steadily,
Lynx repairs PR feedback already given...

I need something that *gives* code review feedback rather than receives it.
Something intelligent, detail-oriented, that notices what others miss.

I walk past the predators — Panther strikes too fast, too focused.
I need a thinker.

## Candidates

**Crow** 🐦‍⬛
- Natural meaning: Highly intelligent bird, known for problem-solving and memory
- Why it fits: Crows recognize patterns, remember faces, leave "gifts" (good feedback)
- The vibe: Smart, slightly unnerving, ultimately helpful
- Potential issues: Could feel negative if "crow" evokes death

**Hawk** 🦅
- Natural meaning: Sharp-eyed predator, sees detail from above
- Why it fits: Survey/overview view, catches what others miss
- Potential issues: Already used (hawk-survey for security)

**Magpie** 🐦
- Natural meaning: Collects shiny things, very clever
- Why it fits: Collects issues like shiny things
- Potential issues: Too playful for serious code review

## Selection: Crow

Crow's intelligence and pattern recognition fits perfectly. The "leaving gifts"
behavior — crows leave objects for humans who feed them — maps to providing
good feedback. And the slightly unnerving-but-helpful vibe is right.

**Workflow name:** The Review

**Phases:**
```
PERCH → OBSERVE → CAW → GIFT → FLY
```
```

## The Three Questions (Always Answer These)

1. **What is it?** (fundamentally, in nature)
2. **What does it do?** (in the user's workflow)
3. **What emotion should it evoke?** (the feeling it creates)
