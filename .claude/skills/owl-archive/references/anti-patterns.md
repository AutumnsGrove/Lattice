# Owl Archive — Anti-Patterns & Words to Avoid

## Em-Dashes

**Avoid em-dashes (—).** One tasteful use per thousand words, maximum. Use commas, periods, or parentheses instead.

**Avoid:** The forest—our home—is where we gather.
**Better:** The forest is our home. It's where we gather.
**Also fine:** The forest (our home) is where we gather.

## The "Not X, But Y" Pattern

This phrasing is deeply AI-coded. Avoid it entirely.

**Never write:**
- "It's not X, but Y"
- "It's not just X, but Y"
- "It's not merely X, but rather Y"
- "Grove isn't just a platform, it's a home"

**Instead, just say the thing:**
- "Grove is a home for your words."
- "This is where you belong."

## Overused AI Words

| Category | Words to Avoid |
|----------|----------------|
| **Adjectives** | robust, seamless, innovative, cutting-edge, transformative, intricate, captivating, comprehensive |
| **Nouns** | tapestry, camaraderie, realm, plethora, myriad, landscape, journey (when not literal) |
| **Verbs** | delve, foster, leverage, navigate, empower, embark, unlock, harness |
| **Phrases** | at the end of the day, in today's world, it goes without saying, needless to say |

## Heavy Transition Words

These make text feel stiff and robotic:

- Furthermore
- Moreover
- Additionally
- In conclusion
- That being said
- It's worth noting that
- It's important to note

**Instead:** Let ideas connect naturally. Use short transitions like "And," "But," "So," "Still." Or no transition at all — just start the next thought.

## Semantic Echoes

Don't repeat the same adjective or descriptor multiple times. AI does this constantly.

**Bad:**
> Grove provides a seamless experience. The seamless integration means you can seamlessly move between features.

**Good:**
> Grove gets out of your way. Move between features without friction.

## Generic Safe Claims

AI hedges. Humans commit.

**Bad:** "This may help improve your workflow in many cases."
**Good:** "This makes your workflow faster."

## Structural Anti-Patterns

**Dense walls of text** — One idea per paragraph. Two to four sentences is usually right. White space is your friend.

**Everything as bullets** — Don't turn narrative content into bullets. Sometimes prose flows better.

**Good use of lists:**
- Specific steps in a process
- Features that are truly parallel
- Quick reference information

**Bad use of lists:**
- Narrative content broken awkwardly
- Things that would read better as a sentence

**Vague headers** — "Guidelines" is worse than "Writing Guidelines." "Voice" is worse than "What Grove Sounds Like." Action-oriented headers work well for help docs: "Add Your First Post" not "Posts."

**Overused callouts** — Use sparingly. Don't use callouts for things that should just be in the text.

```
> 💡 **Tip:** Helpful suggestion that enhances understanding.
> ⚠️ **Warning:** Something that could cause problems if ignored.
```

## Error Message Anti-Patterns

**Over-apologizing:**
```
We're SO sorry!!! We feel TERRIBLE about this!!!
Please forgive us and try again!
```

**Being cute when things are broken:**
```
Oops! 😅 Looks like something went wrong! Don't worry though,
these things happen!
```

**Cold technical error:**
```
Error 500: Internal Server Error. Contact administrator.
```

**What to do instead:**
1. Say what happened (briefly)
2. Say what they can do (if anything)
3. Don't over-apologize (one "sorry" max)
4. Don't be cute when things are broken

## Self-Review Checklist

Before finalizing any Grove documentation:

- [ ] Read it aloud. Does it sound human?
- [ ] Check for em-dashes. Remove them.
- [ ] Search for "not just" and "but rather." Rewrite.
- [ ] Look for words from the avoid list. Replace them.
- [ ] Vary sentence length. No monotone rhythm.
- [ ] Cut unnecessary transitions. Ideas should flow naturally.
- [ ] Is the closer earned? If forced, remove it.
- [ ] Would you want to read this at 2 AM in a tea shop?
