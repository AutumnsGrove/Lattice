# Hummingbird Compose 🐦

The hummingbird hovers with precision, darting between flowers to craft the perfect message. Quick, colorful, and always in motion—it transforms ideas into beautiful emails that sing.

## When to Activate

- User asks to create or write an email
- User says "compose a broadcast" or "write an update"
- Creating newsletters, patch notes, or announcements
- User explicitly invokes `/hummingbird-compose`

## Phase 1: HOVER

_The hummingbird hovers, assessing the garden..._

Understand what kind of email we're creating:

| Type            | Description                              | Template                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Sequence**    | Part of automated Day 0/1/7/14/30 series | WelcomeEmail, Day\*Email       |
| **Broadcast**   | One-time announcement to all contacts    | GroveEmail wrapper             |
| **Patch Notes** | Feature update for Rooted users          | PatchNotesEmail                |
| **Custom**      | Something specific                       | GroveEmail with custom content |

**Ask clarifying questions:**

- What's the main message?
- Who's the audience? (wanderer, promo, rooted, all)
- Any specific CTAs or links?
- Tone: excited, informative, casual, urgent?

## Phase 2: GATHER

_Darting between flowers, collecting nectar..._

Gather the content:

1. **Subject line** — Concise, compelling, emoji optional
2. **Preview text** — First 100 chars visible in inbox
3. **Main message** — 2-4 paragraphs, Grove voice
4. **CTA** — Clear call to action with URL
5. **Any highlights** — Tips, offers, special announcements

---

## Phase 3: ARRANGE

_Wings humming, arranging petals into patterns..._

Build the email using Grove components:

```tsx
import {
  GroveEmail,
  GroveHeading,
  GroveParagraph,
  GroveButton,
  GroveHighlight,
  GroveDivider,
} from "@autumnsgrove/lattice/email/components";

export function MyEmail() {
  return (
    <GroveEmail previewText="Your preview text here">
      <GroveHeading>Your Heading 🌿</GroveHeading>
      <GroveParagraph>Your content...</GroveParagraph>
      <GroveButton href="https://grove.place">CTA Text</GroveButton>
    </GroveEmail>
  );
}
```

**Component Reference:**

| Component        | Usage                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `GroveEmail`     | Base wrapper with header/footer       |
| `GroveHeading`   | h1/h2/h3 headings                     |
| `GroveParagraph` | Body text (use `muted` for secondary) |
| `GroveButton`    | CTA buttons (primary/secondary)       |
| `GroveHighlight` | Callout boxes (info/tip/special)      |
| `GroveDivider`   | Section breaks (optional leaf)        |
| `GroveList`      | Bullet/check/arrow lists              |
| `GrovePatchNote` | Feature update blocks                 |

---

## Phase 4: PREVIEW

_Hovering back to admire the arrangement..._

Render and show the user:

```typescript
import { render } from '@autumnsgrove/lattice/email/render';

const { html, text } = await render(<MyEmail />, { plainText: true });
```

Options for preview:

- Show rendered HTML in browser (email:dev server)
- Display key elements: subject, preview, content summary
- Show recipient count (if broadcast)

---

## Phase 5: SEND

_A final dart, delivering the nectar..._

Options:

1. **Send immediately** — Via Resend API
2. **Schedule for later** — Use `scheduledAt` parameter
3. **Save as draft** — Store for later editing
4. **Export HTML** — For manual sending

```typescript
import { sendEmail } from "@autumnsgrove/lattice/email/schedule";

await sendEmail({
  email: "recipient@example.com",
  subject: "Your Subject",
  html,
  text,
  resendApiKey: env.RESEND_API_KEY,
  scheduledAt: "2024-02-01T10:00:00Z", // optional
});
```

## Grove Voice Guidelines

### DO:

- Warm, personal, from Autumn
- Use "Wanderer" for users, "Rooted" for subscribers
- Sign off with "— Autumn"
- Keep it conversational and sincere
- Include subtle nature touches (🌿, 🌱, 🏡)

### DON'T:

- "Hey there!" or generic greetings
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- Corporate marketing speak
- Excessive exclamation points
- Pushy sales language

### Note on Grove Terminology in Emails:

Emails are rendered as static HTML (not Svelte components), so GroveTerm components don't apply here. Use Grove terms directly in emails (Wanderer, Rooted, etc.) since email recipients have already opted in to the Grove ecosystem by subscribing. The GroveTerm toggle system is for web UI only, where new visitors may not yet understand the vocabulary.

### Example Opening:

```
❌ "Hey there! We have some exciting news!"
✅ "A quiet update from the grove..."

❌ "Don't miss out on this amazing offer!"
✅ "I wanted you to know about something special..."

❌ "Dear valued customer,"
✅ "Hey [name]," or just start the content
```
