# Grove Design Context

> **When to load:** Building UI, writing user-facing text, choosing colors/typography, or making aesthetic decisions.

## Users

Grove serves friends, queer creators, independent writers, and indie web enthusiasts who want their own space online—away from big tech algorithms and extractive platforms. Users arrive seeking refuge: a cozy, authentic place to write, share, and belong. They value ownership, community, and spaces that feel _genuinely_ theirs.

## Brand Personality

**Warm, introspective, queer.** Grove speaks like a trusted friend who runs a midnight tea shop—never performative, always sincere. The voice is:

- **Welcoming** — Every visitor should feel they've found somewhere safe
- **Grounded** — Confident without being loud, capable without being corporate
- **Authentic** — This is your space; we help you speak, not perform

## Emotional Goals

When someone lands on Grove, they should feel:

1. **Safe refuge** — A cozy shelter from the hostile internet
2. **Creative sanctuary** — An inspiring space to express freely
3. **Community belonging** — Part of something bigger, not alone

## Aesthetic Direction

**Nature-themed glassmorphism with seasonal depth.** The visual language evokes a forest clearing where digital and organic coexist peacefully.

**Core palette:** Grove greens, warm bark browns, soft cream neutrals
**Signature elements:** Randomized forests, falling petals/leaves/snow, glass surfaces over nature
**Seasons:** Spring (renewal), Summer (growth), Autumn (harvest/default), Winter (rest), Midnight (dreams)

**Reference feel:** Studio Ghibli's lived-in warmth meets a well-organized indie bookshop
**Anti-references:** Corporate SaaS sterility, social media engagement-bait, generic website builders

## Design Principles

1. **Content-first, decoration-second** — Nature elements enhance readability, never obstruct it. Glass surfaces create hierarchy while hinting at beauty beneath.

2. **Alive but not distracting** — Subtle animations, seasonal changes, and randomization create a living world. Everything respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

3. **Accessible by design** — WCAG AA minimum, with special attention to reduced motion (all animation optional), screen reader excellence, and low vision support. Touch targets 44×44px minimum.

4. **Organic over rigid** — Soft corners (grove border radius), natural color progressions, hand-drawn-feeling nature components. Never sharp or corporate.

5. **Warm in dark mode too** — Dark mode isn't just inverted colors; it's "nature at night" with maintained warmth and character.
