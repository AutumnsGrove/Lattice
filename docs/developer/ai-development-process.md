# Building with AI: The Grove Development Process

> *How Grove was built in 50 days using Claude Code, Kilo Code, and AI-assisted development.*

---

## Coming Soon

This guide is being written. It will cover:

### The Workflow

- How to structure prompts and context effectively
- Working with Claude Code CLI vs web vs mobile
- When to use which interface
- Managing long-running development sessions

### The Mental Model

- Thinking alongside AI instead of just prompting it
- Breaking complex features into AI-friendly chunks
- When to let AI lead vs when to direct specifically
- Building intuition for what AI does well

### Rapid Prototyping

- Moving fast without breaking things
- Using AI for exploration vs implementation
- Iteration patterns that work at speed
- Knowing when to slow down

### Code Quality at Speed

- Maintaining standards during rapid development
- Review patterns for AI-generated code
- Testing strategies when moving fast
- Documentation that keeps pace

### Tools Used

- **Claude Code CLI** — Primary development interface
- **Claude Web** — Mobile and browser-based sessions
- **Kilo Code** — Additional AI coding assistant
- **The skills system** — Custom workflows for common tasks

## Why This Matters

Grove was built from scratch in under 50 days:

- Full multi-tenant blogging platform
- Authentication system (Heartwood)
- Status page (Clearing)
- Knowledge base with 300+ documents
- 30+ technical specifications
- Design system with seasonal themes
- Nature components library
- And much more

This isn't about AI replacing developers. It's about a new way of working where AI amplifies what's possible for a solo developer or small team.
