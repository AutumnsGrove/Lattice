# Curio: Clip Art

> Extracted from Curio Safari expedition plan. Agent-handoff ready.
> **Safari status**: Shallow (deferred)
> **Source**: `docs/plans/planned/curio-safari.md`, Section 17

**Character**: Decorative flair. Little critters, borders, and sparkles scattered on your pages.

### Major gap: No public component

- [ ] **CurioClipArt.svelte does NOT exist** — admin page is complete
- [ ] Admin supports: asset selection, page targeting, x/y positioning (0-100%), scale, rotation, z-index
- [ ] Placements grouped by page path

### Implementation needed

- [ ] Build `CurioClipArt.svelte` — render positioned overlays on target pages
- [ ] Assets need to be created/curated — what clip art ships with Grove?
- [ ] Consider: absolute positioning over page content vs. margin decorations
- [ ] Animated clip art options? (butterflies, falling leaves)

### Admin

- [ ] (Functional — placement editor with position/scale/rotation controls)
