# Grove Storytelling Posts — Blog Launch Strategy

> These aren't marketing posts. They're honest writing about why Grove exists,
> written on Grove itself, shared where the right people will find them.
> The best promotion for a writing platform is writing.

**Strategy:** Write on your own grove. Share via Zephyr to Bluesky.
Post to one indie web community per piece. Let the writing do the work.

**Audiences:** IndieWeb, Neocities/old web revival, 32-Bit Cafe,
queer tech spaces, small web / yesterweb, dev community (HN, lobste.rs)

## The Posts

### 1. "For My Friends"

**Type:** Personal letter
**Audience:** Everyone, but especially the people you built it for
**Mood:** Vulnerable. Tender. The one that made you cry thinking about it.

Not addressed to "potential users." Addressed to the specific people you
built Grove for. Your queer friends who don't feel safe online. Your
neurodivergent friends who deserve better than dopamine slot machines.
Arturo, who actually showed up and posted. The barista you almost told
but didn't. The friends you haven't met yet.

Deeply personal, deeply specific — and that's what makes it universal.

**Why it works:** People share things that make them feel seen. Someone
will read this and think "she built this for people like me" and send
it to someone else.

### 2. "I Built a Forest on the Internet"

**Type:** Origin story
**Audience:** Indie web, queer tech, general
**Mood:** Warm, honest, a little wild

The emotional origin story. Not the technical one — the human one.
Why you started. The loneliness. The anger at watching friends get
chewed up by platforms. The manic 3am sessions. The fact that you
named every piece after something that grows — Heartwood, Meadow,
Clearing, Shade, Centennial.

Not "I had a vision for a platform." More like "I was angry and lonely
and I started building and I couldn't stop."

**Why it works:** People connect with people before they connect with
products. This is the one that would travel furthest.

---

### 3. "I'm Terrified to Tell You About This"

**Type:** Meta / vulnerability
**Audience:** Neurodivergent creators, indie builders, introverts
**Mood:** Scared, honest, a little funny

The irony post. You built a whole social platform while being deeply
antisocial. You built a community space from a coffee shop in Georgia
where you barely talk to anyone. The idea of promoting it makes you
want to crawl under a blanket. But here you are, writing about it,
because the thing you built matters more than the fear.

**Why it works:** Every indie creator has felt this. Every neurodivergent
person who's made something they're proud of but can't bring themselves
to share it will recognize themselves here.

### 4. "22 Curios in a Day"

**Type:** Build log / neurodivergent experience
**Audience:** Developers, neurodivergent community, old web enthusiasts
**Mood:** Electric, honest about mania, celebratory

What hyperfocus actually looks like from inside. Not productivity porn —
the real version. Guestbooks and mood rings and shrines pouring out of
you. Hit counters with 4 styles. Webrings. Custom cursors. Ambient
backgrounds. All in one day. What it's like to build while your brain
is on fire.

Then: the safari afterward, where you systematically planned how to
make each one beautiful. The manic burst AND the careful follow-through.

**Why it works:** The Neocities/old-web crowd will love the curio list
itself. The neurodivergent crowd will love the honest framing.

---

### 5. "Your Blog Should Outlive You"

**Type:** Philosophy / manifesto
**Audience:** IndieWeb, digital preservation, thoughtful readers
**Mood:** Quiet, profound, a little heavy

The Centennial post. After 12 months on a paid plan, your blog is
archived for 100 years — even if you stop paying, even if Grove
disappears. What that means. Why it matters. The internet is full
of dead links and disappeared blogs. What if it didn't have to be?

Your words should outlive the platform. Your words should outlive _you_.

**Why it works:** This is a genuinely novel idea that nobody else offers.
IndieWeb and digital preservation communities would engage deeply.
This is the kind of post that gets cited and linked for years.

---

### 6. "I Blocked the Robots"

**Type:** Topical / activist
**Audience:** AI ethics community, privacy advocates, writers
**Mood:** Defiant, protective, clear

What AI scraping actually looks like. What it means that your words
get hoovered up without consent to train models. What Shade does
about it — not a think piece, an actual working defense system.

This is timely. AI ethics is the hottest conversation in tech right
now and you have a _concrete answer_, not just an opinion.

**Why it works:** Timely topic + working product = shareability.
Writers who are angry about AI scraping will find this and care.

---

### 7. "The Internet I Remember"

**Type:** Nostalgia / cultural
**Audience:** 32-Bit Cafe, Neocities, yesterweb, anyone over 25
**Mood:** Warm, wistful, hopeful

What the old web actually felt like — guestbooks, hit counters,
webrings, "under construction" gifs, GeoCities neighborhoods.
Why those things mattered. Why they weren't just kitsch — they were
_human_. Why Grove brings them back as genuine features, not irony.

The internet didn't have to become what it became. Here's a door
back to the version we lost.

**Why it works:** Nostalgia is powerful, but nostalgia + "and I
actually rebuilt it" is unstoppable. The 32-Bit Cafe and old web
communities would devour this.

---

### 8. "What's Under the Hood of a One-Person Platform"

**Type:** Technical deep-dive
**Audience:** Developers, Hacker News, lobste.rs, tech bloggers
**Mood:** Confident, detailed, impressive

The architecture post. 22 packages. 7 Durable Objects on a custom
SDK you built yourself (Loom). A rate limiting framework (Threshold).
WASM modules in Zig. Cloudflare Workers, D1, KV, R2. SVG trees that
change with the seasons. All from one developer in Georgia.

Developers love reading about how indie projects are architected.
This reaches a completely different crowd — people who might not need
a blog themselves but know someone who does.

**Why it works:** HN loves "one person built all this?" posts.
This gets you dev community visibility and respect.

---

### 9. "A Place to Be"

**Type:** Prose / almost poetry
**Audience:** Everyone
**Mood:** Quiet, still, spacious

Short. Maybe 300 words. What it means to just _exist_ on the internet
without performing. Without metrics. Without likes. Without an
algorithm deciding who sees your words. What it feels like to write
into a space that's yours and nobody's watching over your shoulder.

Not a pitch. Not a manifesto. Just a feeling, written down.

**Why it works:** Sometimes the shortest thing hits the hardest.
This is the one people screenshot and share without commentary.

## Suggested Order

Not rigid — follow your gut. But if you want a sequence:

1. **"For My Friends"** — start with heart. This is the lantern at the door.
2. **"I Built a Forest on the Internet"** — the origin story, for wider reach.
3. **"I Blocked the Robots"** — timely, topical, draws a new crowd.
4. **"The Internet I Remember"** — nostalgia hook for the old web community.
5. **"22 Curios in a Day"** — the wild build log, for the ND/dev crowd.
6. The rest as they come to you.

_These aren't sales pitches. They're lanterns. You light them one at a time
and leave them at the edge of the grove. The people who need the light
will find their way in._
