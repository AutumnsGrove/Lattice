# Workshop "What Is" Articles Plan

**Created**: January 28, 2026
**Status**: Planning
**Priority**: Medium — completes documentation coverage for workshop tools
**Estimated Effort**: 9-11 focused writing sessions
**Prerequisites**: None
**Related**: `docs/plans/planned/help-center-article-roadmap.md`

---

## Overview

The Workshop showcases **47 tools** across 8 categories. Currently, **8 tools** have dedicated "What Is" articles. After reviewing for relevance, **14 tools** are being skipped (internal/developer-focused/too early). This plan covers **25 tool articles** plus **3 concept articles** (28 total).

**Goal**: Every user-facing tool in the Workshop should have a corresponding "What Is" article, plus key concepts that Wanderers need to understand Grove.

## Intentionally Skipped (14 tools)

These tools don't need "What Is" articles — they're internal, developer-focused, too niche, or too early in planning.

| Tool         | Reason                                                               |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vista**    | Operator-only infrastructure monitoring                              |
| **Outpost**  | Personal Minecraft server, niche                                     |
| **Bloom**    | Personal dev tool, not core to blogging                              |
| **Press**    | Developer CLI, not user-facing                                       |
| **Etch**     | Planned, tangential to blogging core                                 |
| **Patina**   | Internal backups — covered by "your data is safe" mentions elsewhere |
| **Lumen**    | Internal AI routing — invisible to users                             |
| **Mycelium** | MCP server for developers/AI agents                                  |
| **Gossamer** | npm package for devs, not user-facing                                |
| **Nook**     | Private video sharing, very niche                                    |
| **Vineyard** | Meta-pattern about documentation                                     |
| **Burrow**   | Cross-property access — too early, concept may evolve                |
| **Wander**   | Immersive 3D discovery — write when closer to reality                |
| **Forests**  | Community aggregators — depends on Meadow maturity                   |

| #   | Article                      | Purpose                              | Links to                                                   |
| --- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 26  | **what-is-greenhouse.md**    | Early access / beta testing mode     | Grafts, Burrow workshop entries                            |
| 27  | **what-is-midnight-mode.md** | The fifth season — Grove at night    | Prism, Foliage, seasonal theming                           |
| 28  | **what-are-tiers.md**        | Seedling/Sapling/Oak/Evergreen tiers | Pricing page, Centennial, Rings, Ivy, feature availability |

**Note on tiers article**: This should be a quick-reference that explains what each tier includes, with links to:

- Pricing page
- `what-is-centennial.md` (unlocks at 12 months Sapling+)
- Features gated by tier (Rings analytics, Ivy email, etc.)

---

## Article Template

Each "What Is" article should follow this structure:

```markdown
---
title: "What is [Tool Name]?"
description: "[One-sentence description for SEO]"
section: "how-it-works"
order: [number]
---

# What is [Tool Name]?

[Opening paragraph: warm introduction explaining what the tool does in plain language. Use Grove voice — like explaining to a friend over tea.]

## Why [Tool Name] exists

[1-2 paragraphs explaining the problem it solves and why Grove built it this way.]

## How it works

[2-3 paragraphs explaining the mechanics. Be concrete but not overly technical. Use analogies where helpful.]

## What this means for you

[1-2 paragraphs from the Wanderer's perspective. What do they get? What do they need to do (or not do)?]

## Related

- [Link to spec if exists]
- [Link to related articles]
- [Link to workshop page section]
```

### Voice Guidelines

- **Warm, not corporate** — "Your words are yours" not "Content ownership is guaranteed"
- **Concrete, not abstract** — "Press a button and your theme changes" not "Seamless customization flows"
- **Honest about status** — If it's planned, say so. Don't oversell.
- **Grove terminology** — Wanderers (not users), Rooted (not subscribers), etc.

---

## File Locations

All articles go in: `docs/help-center/articles/`

After creating each article:

1. Article is auto-discovered by `docs-scanner.ts` via frontmatter
2. Appears in knowledge base under the `how-it-works` section
3. Link from Workshop page using `whatIsLink` property

---

## Workshop Integration

When an article is created, update the corresponding tool in `apps/landing/src/routes/workshop/+page.svelte`:

```typescript
{
  name: 'ToolName',
  // ... other properties
  whatIsLink: '/knowledge/help/what-is-toolname'  // ADD THIS
}
```

**Note for Centennial**: Keep the existing `howLink` pointing to `/knowledge/philosophy/grove-sustainability`. The "What Is" article explains the feature; the "How we'll do it" link explains the philosophy and funding model.

---

## Success Metrics

- **Priority 1 complete**: 4 core articles (Heartwood, Arbor, Flow, Terrarium)
- **Priorities 1-3 complete**: 14 articles (all daily-use tools covered)
- **Full coverage**: 28 articles total (25 tools + 3 concepts), all linked appropriately

---

## Notes for the Agent

When writing these articles:

1. **Read the spec first** — Most tools have specs at `/knowledge/specs/[toolname]-spec`. Pull accurate details from there.

2. **Check the Workshop description** — The `description` field in `workshop/+page.svelte` has the canonical one-liner for each tool.

3. **Use Grove voice** — Invoke skill: `grove-documentation` before writing user-facing text.

4. **Keep it short** — Target 400-600 words. These are introductory explainers, not comprehensive guides.

5. **Link back** — Always include a link to the Workshop section and spec (if it exists).

6. **Update Workshop** — After writing each article, add the `whatIsLink` property to the tool in the Workshop page.

7. **Planned features get full articles** — Don't write stubs. Explain the vision clearly, but be honest that it's not built yet.
