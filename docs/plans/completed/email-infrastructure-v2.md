# Grove Email Infrastructure v2 - COMPLETED

Issue: #453
Completed: 2026-02-01

## Overview

Complete overhaul of Grove's automated email infrastructure. Replaced the outdated landing page email system with a unified, modern approach using React Email for beautiful templates, Resend for delivery with native scheduling, and D1 as the source of truth for audience segmentation.

## What Was Built

| Component | Old | New |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Templates | Plain HTML tables | React Email component system |
| Scheduling | Cloudflare cron daily | Resend native `scheduled_at` + catch-up cron |
| Segmentation | Single table, no categories | D1 audience types: `wanderer`, `promo`, `rooted` |
| Design system | None | Grove Email Components (warm, colorful, branded) |
| Link handling | Hardcoded URLs | Smart `/go/*` redirects for tenant-agnostic URLs |

## Audience Types (Updated from Plan)

- **Wanderer**: Signed up on landing page (grove.place), just curious
- **Promo**: Signed up via Plant, showing intent but hasn't purchased
- **Rooted**: Purchased a subscription, active member

> Note: Changed from "waitlist/trial/rooted" to "wanderer/promo/rooted" to match Grove's naming philosophy.

## Email Sequences Implemented

| Day | Wanderer | Promo | Rooted |
|-----|----------|-------|--------|
| 0 | "Welcome to the Grove 🌿" | "You found Grove 🌱" | "Welcome home 🏡" |
| 1 | — | — | "Making it yours" |
| 7 | "What makes Grove different" | "Still thinking about it?" | "The blank page" |
| 14 | "Why Grove exists" | — | — |
| 30 | "Still there? 👋" | — | — |
| Ongoing | — | — | Patch notes |

### Voice Guidelines Applied

- "Found your way here" Wanderer metaphor throughout
- Present tense (Grove is launched)
- "I built" not "we built" for authentic voice
- No em-dashes, no AI-isms
- Short promo sequence (2 emails, honest and done)

## Smart Link System

Created `/go/*` redirect handler for tenant-agnostic email URLs:

```typescript
// URLs that work for any user
GROVE_URLS = {
  ARBOR_PANEL: "https://grove.place/go/admin",
  NEW_POST: "https://grove.place/go/posts/new",
  SETTINGS: "https://grove.place/go/settings",
  // ... etc
}
```

The `/go/*` handler redirects authenticated users to their specific arbor panel.

## Database Migration

Created `apps/landing/migrations/0006_email_audience_segmentation.sql`:

- Added `audience_type` column (default: 'wanderer')
- Added `sequence_stage` column
- Added `last_email_at` column
- Created index for catch-up cron queries
- Migrated existing boolean tracking flags to new schema

## Quality Assurance

### Tests Written (70 tests, 189 assertions)

**types.test.ts:**
- Audience type coverage
- Sequence stage values
- Each audience's sequence configuration
- Cross-sequence consistency
- Template naming conventions

**urls.test.ts:**
- GROVE_URLS constant values
- buildGoUrl function
- buildEmailUrl UTM tracking
- URL safety checks

### Security Audit (🦝 Raccoon)

- ✅ No hardcoded secrets (API keys from env)
- ✅ No dangerous methods (innerHTML, eval)
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Type-safe props throughout
- ✅ Unsubscribe via Resend token

### Accessibility Audit (🦌 Deer)

- ✅ `lang="en"` on HTML element
- ✅ Alt text on logo image
- ✅ `role="presentation"` on layout tables
- ✅ High contrast colors
- ✅ Good font sizes (16px body)

### Performance (🦊 Fox)

- Module size: 136KB (lightweight)
- ~2630 lines total
- Server-side rendering only
- No client bundle impact

## Commits

1. `feat(email): add /go/* smart link redirect handler`
2. `feat(email): rewrite sequences with Grove voice and audience segmentation`
3. `feat(email): add lifecycle and seasonal templates`
4. `test(email): add comprehensive tests for types and URL helpers`

## Remaining Work
