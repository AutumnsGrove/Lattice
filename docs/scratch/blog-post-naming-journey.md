# Blog & Post Naming Journey

> *The two hardest words to replace. The heart of everything.*

---

## The Challenge

"Blog" and "post" are everywhere. They're in:
- Database tables
- URLs
- User-facing text
- Documentation
- Every API endpoint

But more than that—they're *fundamental concepts*. A blog isn't just a feature. It's the thing. It's why someone comes to Grove. And a post isn't just content. It's the act of putting something into the world.

This isn't like naming a status page (Clearing) or a backup system (Patina). This is naming the tree itself.

## Walking Through the Grove

```
                        ☀️

              🌲        🌳        🌲        🌲

        🌲       🌳       🌳       🌲       🌲

      ════════════════════════════════════════════
                 The Grove Floor
              (where Wanderers walk)
      ════════════════════════════════════════════
```

I enter the grove.

Around me: trees. Each tree is a Wanderer who took root. Their branches reach toward the sky, their roots reach toward each other through the mycelium below.

I'm walking to visit Autumn's tree. I see it ahead—
I see... what? Their **blog**?

No. I see their *tree*. Their space. Their home in the grove.

I get closer. I want to read what they wrote. I want to see their latest **post**—

No. I want to see their... their what?

---

## What IS a Blog?

Let me sit with this.

**What it does:**
- A blog is someone's space. Their corner of the grove.
- It contains everything they've written.
- It has their personality (Foliage), their tools (Curios), their conversations (Reeds).
- It exists at `autumn.grove.place`

**What it IS in Grove metaphor:**
- The tree itself? But "every Wanderer is a tree."
- A plot of land? A clearing?
- A den? A hollow? A canopy?

**The existing metaphor chain:**
- Wanderer → takes root → becomes Rooted
- Their tree grows in the grove
- They tend it with Arbor (the admin)
- They decorate with Foliage
- They add Curios

So the blog... is the tree? Or is it what grows ON the tree?

---

## What IS a Post?

**What it does:**
- A post is a single piece of writing
- It has a title, content, maybe images
- It gets published, shared, commented on (Reeds)
- It lives in time—published on a date

**What it IS in Grove metaphor:**
- A leaf? (seasonal, many, individual)
- A branch? (extends outward, grows over time)
- A fruit? (something produced, shared with others)
- A seed? (contains an idea, can spread)
- Sap/Resin? (the essence flowing)

## Candidates: The Blog

Let me think through possibilities...

### 1. Tree
*"Your tree in the grove"*

The obvious choice. Every wanderer IS a tree. But wait—the person is the tree, or their blog is the tree? This conflation might actually work. You ARE your tree. Your writings are its expression.

**Pros:** Already implicit in the language ("take root," "your tree grows")
**Cons:** Might be too abstract? "Go visit their tree" vs "go visit their blog"

### 2. Hollow
*"A cozy hollow in the tree"*

A hollow is the space inside a tree where animals make homes. Private, protected, intimate.

**Pros:** Warm, cozy, feels like a home
**Cons:** Implies the blog is INSIDE something, not the primary thing

### 3. Canopy
*"Your canopy in the grove"*

The canopy is what people see from below—the crown of the tree, the foliage visible to others.

**Pros:** Public-facing, visible, what represents you
**Cons:** Foliage already exists for theming

### 4. Grove (personal)
*"Your grove"*

Wait—could someone's blog be their own little grove? A grove within the Grove?

**Pros:** "autumn.grove.place" → "Autumn's grove" feels natural
**Cons:** Confusing—Grove is the platform, grove is also your space?

### 5. Plot
*"Your plot in the grove"*

A plot of land. Where your tree grows. Your territory.

**Pros:** Clear, grounded, implies ownership
**Cons:** Feels more garden than forest

### 6. Stand
*"Your stand of trees"*

A stand is a cluster of trees in forestry. But one person, one stand?

**Cons:** Doesn't quite fit the singular nature

### 7. Hearth
*"Your hearth"*

A hearth is the center of a home. Warmth, gathering, the place you return to.

**Pros:** Incredibly warm, "come visit my hearth"
**Cons:** Not nature-specific (though forest cabins have hearths)

### 8. Den
*"Your den"*

Where an animal lives. Cozy, protected, personal.

**Pros:** Warm, intimate, "visit my den"
**Cons:** Might feel too small/hidden for a public blog

---

## Candidates: The Post

### 1. Leaf
*"A new leaf"*

Leaves are what the tree produces. Seasonal, many, individual, beautiful.

**Pros:** "I wrote a new leaf" / "Read my latest leaf" / "autumn.grove.place/leaves"
**Cons:** Leaves fall and die—is that the vibe? Though rebirth is part of the cycle.

### 2. Branch
*"A new branch"*

Branches extend outward, permanent, grow over time.

**Pros:** Structure, permanence
**Cons:** Feels more like categories/sections than individual posts

### 3. Fruit
*"New fruit from the grove"*

Fruit is what a tree produces to share with the world. Contains seeds (ideas) that can spread.

**Pros:** Sharing, nurturing, something you offer others
**Cons:** "Read my latest fruit" sounds weird?

### 4. Seed
*"A new seed"*

Seeds contain ideas. They travel, take root elsewhere, grow into new things.

**Pros:** Ideas spreading through the grove
**Cons:** Seeds are potential, not finished work. Posts are complete things.

### 5. Bloom
*"A new bloom"*

Blooms are flowers—moments of expression, color, beauty.

**Pros:** "autumn.grove.place/blooms" / "Read their latest bloom"
**Cons:** Bloom is already the remote coding infrastructure

### 6. Ring
*"A new ring"*

Tree rings record growth over time...

**Cons:** Rings is already analytics. Also, rings are internal/private.

### 7. Bark
*"New bark"*

The outer layer of the tree...

**Cons:** Protective layer, not expressive content

### 8. Sap
*"Fresh sap"*

The life flowing through the tree...

**Cons:** Too internal? Sap isn't shared, it flows within

### 9. Page
*"A new page"*

Already exists for static pages...

**Cons:** Confusing overlap

### 10. Entry
*"A new entry"*

Generic journal terminology...

**Cons:** Not nature-themed

### 11. Note
*"A new note"*

From birdsong—notes are the individual sounds birds make...

**Pros:** "autumn.grove.place/notes" / "Read their notes"
**Cons:** Might feel too casual/small for substantial posts

### 12. Call
*"A new call"*

Bird calls, the way forest creatures communicate...

**Pros:** Communication, voice, reaching out
**Cons:** Ephemeral feel, like social media posts

### 13. Echo
*"A new echo"*

Sound bouncing through the forest...

**Cons:** Echo implies repetition, not original content

### 14. Tale
*"A new tale"*

Stories told around the fire...

**Pros:** "autumn.grove.place/tales" / "Read their tales"
**Cons:** Not everything is a story/narrative

### 15. Letter
*"A new letter"*

Correspondence, messages...

**Cons:** Too formal, implies recipient

## The Walk Continues...

*Sitting on a log, thinking.*

What if I'm overthinking the blog part?

The language already works:
- "Take root" → you have a tree
- "Your tree" → your space
- "Visit their tree" → go to their blog

Maybe "blog" → "tree" is already there. We just... commit to it.

- "Welcome to my tree"
- "I just took root—come see my tree!"
- autumn.grove.place → "Autumn's tree"

For posts... leaves feels right emotionally. Leaves grow on trees. Leaves are seasonal. Leaves fall and new ones come. Leaves in autumn are particularly beautiful (hello, name significance).

- "I wrote a new leaf"
- "Their leaves from last spring"
- "autumn.grove.place/leaves"
- "Read their leaves"

---

## Testing the Tagline

**Tree:**
> "Your tree is your home in the grove."

**Leaf:**
> "Leaves are the words your tree grows."

*Leaves are the words your tree grows.* That's... that's really nice.

---

## The Feeling

**Tree feels like:**
- Permanence
- Growth
- Belonging
- "This is mine"

**Leaf feels like:**
- Expression
- Seasons
- Abundance
- "This is what I'm thinking"

---

## Concerns to Address

### URL Structure
- `autumn.grove.place/leaves` → list of posts
- `autumn.grove.place/leaves/hello-world` → individual post
- Or just `autumn.grove.place/hello-world` (current)?

### Plural vs Singular
- "A leaf" vs "leaves"
- "Write a leaf" vs "Write a new leaf"

### Database/Code Impact
- Table: `posts` → `leaves`? Or keep internal as `posts`?
- Like Lattice (public) vs GroveEngine (internal)?

### The Word "Post" as Verb
- "Post something" → "Grow a leaf"? "Write a leaf"?
- The verb form matters for UI: "New Post" → "New Leaf"

---

## What Feels Right

After this walk, I'm feeling:

**Blog → Tree** (maybe just lean into the existing metaphor)
**Post → Leaf** (words your tree grows, seasonal, expressive)

Or...

---

## Wait. One More Candidate.

What about the sound of rustling leaves? The voice of the tree?

### Whisper
*"A new whisper"*

Trees whisper in the wind. Their leaves rustle, communicating.

- "autumn.grove.place/whispers"
- "Read their whispers"
- "A new whisper from the grove"

**Pros:** Communication, gentle, personal, the tree speaking
**Cons:** Might feel too quiet/small for bold pieces?

### Murmur
*"A murmur through the leaves"*

Similar but with community connotation—murmuring together.

---

## The Question

What feels more like home?

**"Come read my leaves"** — the things my tree grows, seasonal, many
**"Come hear my whispers"** — my tree speaking through the wind

---

*To be continued...*

---

## The Conclusion

*February 2, 2026 — The walk found its end.*

After exploring leaves, whispers, hollows, and dens... Autumn felt it:

**Grove** for your space. Not overlap with the platform—*resonance*. The platform is the Grove. Your space is *your* grove. The possessive makes it personal. And the original URL was autumnsgrove.com. The name was trying to come home.

**Garden** for the collection. Where your blooms grow together. Not a feed, not a list—a garden you've tended.

**Bloom** for your writing. What your grove produces. Moments of expression, color, beauty. "Read my latest bloom."

The old "Bloom" (remote coding infrastructure) becomes **Tendril**—reaching out, doing work, letting go.

### The Final Chain

> You **wander** into the Grove → You **take root** → Your **tree** grows → Your **grove** flourishes → It **blooms**

### Implementation Pattern

Like "step away (unsubscribe)" in emails:
- **UI text:** "Your Garden" / "New Bloom"
- **Aria labels:** "blog posts" / "write new post"
- **URLs:** `/garden` / `/garden/hello-world`

## What Changed

| Old Term | New Term | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| blog | grove | Your space, your corner of the forest |
| blog index | garden | The collection, where blooms grow together |
| post | bloom | What your grove produces |
| Bloom (remote coding) | Tendril | Reaching out, doing work, letting go |

*The name was always there. We just had to walk until we found it.*
