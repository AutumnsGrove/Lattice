# Node-Graph Studio Naming Journey

*January 6, 2026 — Late night walk through the grove*

---

## What Are We Naming?

A **unified node-graph system** that powers two creative modes:
1. **Animation creation** — nature assets, timing/glue connections, motion propagation
2. **Diagram creation** — glass cards, Lucide icons, static visual relationships

Both share:
- Grid-based placement (0.5rem half-steps)
- Node-to-node connections (drawn as lines)
- Visual composition (building complex from simple)
- Lives within or alongside Terrarium

Where existing services live:
- **Meadow** — the open social space (out in the sun)
- **Heartwood** — deep in the tree (core identity)
- **Terrarium** — a glass container (creative composition)
- **Lattice** — the framework everything climbs on
- **Mycelium** — underground connections

---

## What IS This Thing?

### Fundamentally:
It's a **connection system**. Nodes and edges. Visual relationships.
It's a **composition tool**. Building complex from simple.
It's a **framework for creation**. Not the creation itself.

### What it DOES in the user's life:
- **Arranges** — placing things precisely
- **Connects** — drawing relationships
- **Composes** — building up structures
- **Animates** — making things move together (for animation mode)
- **Visualizes** — showing how things relate (for diagram mode)

### The emotion:
- Intention
- Care
- Craft
- Seeing connections clearly

---

## Walking Through the Forest

I enter the grove. I see my blog, my tree.

I open Terrarium to create something for my header—a scene of swaying vines.

But I don't just want to place things randomly. I want them *connected*. I want to jiggle the rock and watch fifteen vines cascade and jangle in sequence.

So I need to see the *structure*. Not just the pretty scene, but the bones beneath it.

I switch to... **what?**

What do I find when I want to see how things connect?

I think of branches overhead, how they interlock into patterns.
I think of a loom, where threads cross and weave.
I think of a bower, that structure a bird builds from collected pieces.
I think of tendrils, reaching out, grasping, connecting.

---

## Candidates

### 1. Bower

**A shelter made of interwoven branches, or a bowerbird's elaborate structure**

```
bower.grove.place (or grove.place/bower, or mode within Terrarium)
```

- Bowerbirds create intricate structures from collected materials
- It's about arrangement, composition, visual appeal
- A bower is *architecture that grows*
- "Open the Bower" — enter the composition studio
- "Build a Bower" — create an interconnected structure

**Tagline:** *"Arrange with intention. Connect with care."*

**Potential issues:**
- Some people don't know what a bower is
- Might sound too "sheltery" when it's really about creation

---

### 2. Canopy

**Where branches interlock overhead**

```
grove.place/canopy
```

- The upper layer of the forest where trees connect
- A network of interlocking branches
- You look up and see the pattern
- "Open the Canopy" — see the connections

**Tagline:** *"Where branches meet."*

**Potential issues:**
- Sounds more observational than creative
- Canopy is a view, not a tool

---

### 3. Weave

**The action of interlacing threads**

```
grove.place/weave
```

- Simple, clear, active verb
- "Weave your scene together"
- You weave nodes and connections into patterns
- Cross-threads creating structure

**Tagline:** *"Weave your world."*

**Potential issues:**
- More textile than nature
- Already using Loom metaphor for D1 batching

---

### 4. Tendril

**The reaching, grasping part of a climbing vine**

```
grove.place/tendril
```

- Tendrils reach out and connect
- How vines grab onto things
- Perfect for the CONNECTION metaphor
- "Draw a tendril" — create a connection between nodes

**Tagline:** *"Reach out. Hold on."*

**Potential issues:**
- Might work better as the name for CONNECTIONS rather than the STUDIO
- "Tendril Studio" sounds a bit odd

---

### 5. Separate Names: Sway + Fern

**Animation mode: Sway** — natural movement, swaying in the wind
**Diagram mode: Fern** — branching, fractal, structured

- Keeps the two use cases distinct
- Each name fits its purpose
- "Create a Sway" — build an animation
- "Draw a Fern" — create a diagram

**Potential issues:**
- Loses the unified engine concept
- Two names to learn instead of one

---

## Testing the Taglines

> "Bower is where you **weave your scenes together**."

> "Canopy is where you **see how everything connects**."

> "Weave is where you **interlace your ideas**."

> "Tendril is where you **reach and connect**."

---

## The Choice: Bower

After walking through, **Bower** feels right.

A bower is:
- Intentionally created (you build it)
- Made of collected materials (your assets)
- Arranged with care (grid placement)
- A structure of relationships (connections)
- Both functional and beautiful

The bowerbird connection is perfect:
- Bowerbirds are famous for their elaborate constructions
- They collect items and arrange them precisely
- The bower is both architecture and art
- It's about composition and connection

**Bower** unifies animation and diagrams:
- Animation: *"Build a Bower of swaying vines"*
- Diagrams: *"Build a Bower of connected ideas"*

And it fits the Grove ecosystem:
- Natural metaphor
- About creation, not just observation
- Warm, intentional, crafted
- Not directly about trees — about what happens in the forest

## The Entry

## Bower
**Visual Composition Studio** · `grove.place/bower`

A bower is a shelter made of interwoven branches, or the elaborate structure a bowerbird creates—carefully arranged, visually composed, built from collected elements. It's architecture that grows.

Bower is Grove's visual composition studio. Place elements on a grid, draw connections between them, watch relationships come alive. Create animations where chained vines ripple when shaken. Build diagrams with glass cards and icons that map your architecture. Whether motion or structure, Bower is where you weave it all together.

The node-graph engine beneath powers both modes: timing and propagation for animation, static relationships for diagrams. Same foundation, different expressions.

*Arrange with intention. Connect with care.*

## Alternative Candidates Summary

| Name | Metaphor | Feeling | Best For |
|------|----------|---------|----------|
| **Bower** | Bowerbird's creation | Crafted, intentional | Unified studio |
| **Canopy** | Interlocking branches | Observational, networked | Viewing connections |
| **Weave** | Threading together | Active, textile | The action |
| **Tendril** | Reaching vine | Grasping, connecting | Connection lines |
| **Sway** | Trees in wind | Motion, flow | Animation mode |
| **Fern** | Branching fronds | Structured, fractal | Diagram mode |

---

## Notes for Tomorrow

- Does "Bower" resonate?
- Should animation and diagrams have distinct sub-names within Bower?
- The connections themselves could be called "tendrils" even if the studio is Bower
- Consider: `grove.place/bower` vs mode within Terrarium

## Final Decision: Weave

*Updated after further discussion*

After living with "Bower" for a few hours, we pivoted to **Weave**.

### Why the change?

**Bower** felt right initially but had friction:
- It's a noun — you *use* a bower, you don't *bower* something
- Requires explaining what a bowerbird is
- More about the result than the action

**Weave** won because:
- It's a **verb** — "weave your scene together" is an action
- Immediately intuitive — everyone knows what weaving means
- The metaphor still works: threads connecting nodes, patterns emerging
- "Weave" as the studio, "Threads" as the connections — natural pairing

### Final naming structure

| Public Name | Internal Name | Icon | Purpose |
|-------------|---------------|------|---------|
| **Weave** | GroveWeave | `spline-pointer` | Unified composition studio |
| **Sway** | GroveSway | `waves` | Animation sub-mode |
| **Fern** | GroveFern | `waypoints` | Diagram sub-mode |
| **Threads** | GroveThreads | `route` | Connections between nodes |

### The tagline

> *Weave your world together.*

Active, warm, clear. Fits Grove's voice perfectly.
