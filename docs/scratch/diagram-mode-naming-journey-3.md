# Naming Journey: Weave Diagram Sub-Mode
*Journey 3 - January 7, 2026*

---

## The Challenge

We're naming the **diagram sub-mode** within Weave (Grove's visual composition studio).

**Already named:**
- **Breeze** - The animation sub-mode (moves through invisibly, gentle, flowing)

**What didn't work:**
- **Trace** — Too generic, passive
- **Dew** — Passive, indifferent, too delicate
- **Frost** — Still indifferent, not action-like enough

**The key insight from the user:**

> "I want it to feel like I'm really CONNECTING something. Because that's ultimately what's happening! It's like a super great feeling. It feels like you're looking at a great big jungle and standing on the edge of a mountain."

---

## What This Thing IS

**Fundamentally:**
- It's an ACTION of connecting
- It's a VANTAGE POINT for seeing everything
- It's about POWER and CLARITY, not delicacy
- It's the satisfaction of linking distant points
- It makes invisible architecture VISIBLE with intention

**What it DOES:**
- Lets you see the whole system laid out
- Lets you draw connections between components
- Gives you that mountaintop feeling
- Creates the sense of standing somewhere high, seeing everything below
- Makes you feel like you're really CONNECTING things

**The emotion:**
- GRANDEUR
- SATISFACTION
- POWER
- CLARITY
- The thrill of seeing patterns emerge

## Visualizing the Grove

              JUNGLE BELOW

   ═══════════════════════════════════
           You're on the RIDGE
        Looking down at everything
       Drawing lines between peaks
```

**Breeze** moves through the trees invisibly
**[This mode]** stands ABOVE, CONNECTS with presence

## Walking Through...

I'm in Weave. I'm building a visual composition.

First, I use **Breeze** to animate things:
- Elements flowing in
- Gentle transitions
- Movement that feels natural
- The breeze moves through, unseen but felt

Now I need to connect components. I need to see the ARCHITECTURE.

I switch to **[Diagram Mode]**.

Suddenly, I'm standing on a ridge. The whole composition spreads out below me like a jungle seen from a mountaintop. I can see EVERYTHING: which components connect to which, how data flows, how the system fits together.

I reach out and draw a line. Component A to Component B. The connection snaps into place. That satisfying click. I'm not just editing—I'm ARCHITECTING. I'm standing at a vantage point, mapping the territory, connecting distant points with intention.

This isn't passive observation. This is active creation from a place of power.

## Candidate Names

### Ridge
**`ridge.weave.grove.place`** (conceptual)

**In nature:**
A ridge is an elevated crest that connects mountain peaks. Standing on a ridge, you see everything: valleys below, distant peaks, the whole landscape laid out. Ridges are the high paths that link summits together. They're exposed, commanding, powerful.

**Why it fits:**
- **VANTAGE POINT**: Ridges give you that elevated view—you see everything
- **CONNECTION**: Ridges literally connect peaks. They're the path between high points.
- **ACTION**: "Ridging" components = creating high-level connections between them
- **POWER**: Standing on a ridge is exposed, bold, commanding
- **CLARITY**: From a ridge, patterns become visible
- **PAIRS WITH BREEZE**: Breeze flows through invisibly; Ridge connects with elevation and presence

**The vibe:**
Standing on a mountain ridge, wind in your face, seeing the whole forest below. Drawing lines between distant peaks. The satisfaction of mapping the invisible made visible.

**Tagline:**
"Ridge is where you stand above it all and draw the connections."

---

### Span
**`span.weave.grove.place`** (conceptual)

**In nature:**
A span is both the distance across something and the act of bridging it. Natural bridges span canyons. Tree roots span ravines. It's about reaching across space to connect.

**Why it fits:**
- **CONNECTION**: Spanning is the act of bridging
- **ACTION**: Active, intentional reaching
- **POWER**: It takes strength to span a gap
- Clear verb: "span these components together"

**Potential issues:**
- Less of the "vantage point" feeling
- Doesn't capture that mountaintop vista energy
- More about the connection itself than seeing everything

---

### Crest
**`crest.weave.grove.place`** (conceptual)

**In nature:**
The crest is the highest line—the peak of a wave, the summit of a mountain, the ridgeline against the sky.

**Why it fits:**
- **VANTAGE POINT**: Crests are high points
- **VISIBILITY**: You see everything from the crest
- Beautiful word, elegant

**Potential issues:**
- Less about the CONNECTION action
- More about the viewpoint than the linking
- Doesn't capture "I'm connecting things" as strongly

---

### Skyline
**`skyline.weave.grove.place`** (conceptual)

**In nature:**
The line where earth meets sky, connecting all the high points into one visible structure. A city skyline shows how everything connects.

**Why it fits:**
- **SEEING STRUCTURE**: Skylines reveal architecture
- **CONNECTION**: All the peaks linked together
- **GRANDEUR**: Epic feeling

**Potential issues:**
- More about viewing than doing
- Less of that active "I'm drawing connections" energy
- Feels a bit urban for Grove?

---

## The Decision

**Ridge** captures everything:

1. ✅ **The vista feeling** - standing on a ridge, seeing everything
2. ✅ **The connection action** - ridges connect peaks
3. ✅ **Power and presence** - exposed, elevated, commanding
4. ✅ **The satisfaction** - drawing lines between distant points
5. ✅ **Makes invisible visible** - from the ridge, you see patterns
6. ✅ **Pairs with Breeze** - Breeze flows through; Ridge connects from above
7. ✅ **Natural metaphor** - part of the forest/mountain ecosystem
8. ✅ **Active, not passive** - you "ridge" components together
9. ✅ **That mountaintop energy** - exactly what the user described

## The Grove Entry

### Ridge
**Where you connect with clarity** · *Weave sub-mode*

A ridge is an elevated crest connecting mountain peaks. Standing on a ridge, the whole landscape spreads below you: valleys, forests, distant summits. Everything is visible. The ridge itself is the high path linking points that would otherwise stand alone.

Ridge is Weave's diagram mode. Switch to Ridge and you're standing above your composition, seeing the whole system at once: which components connect to which, how data flows, how everything fits together. Draw connections between distant elements. Map the invisible architecture. Create with the clarity that comes from elevation.

Breeze moves through your composition invisibly. Ridge connects it from above.

*Stand on the ridge. See everything. Connect with power.*

## The Tagline

**"Ridge is where you stand above it all and draw the connections."**

Or:

**"Connect with clarity from the high path."**

Or:

**"Where elevation becomes understanding."**

---

## Why This Captures the Feeling

The user said: "It feels like you're looking at a great big jungle and standing on the edge of a mountain."

**Ridge is literally that.**

You're on the ridge line—the elevated path—looking down at the jungle of components below. You can see how everything relates. You reach out and draw a line from one peak to another. Connection made. The satisfaction of architecting from a place of power.

It's not passive (like Trace, Dew, Frost). It's ACTIVE. You're standing somewhere high. You're seeing clearly. You're connecting with intention.

And it pairs beautifully with **Breeze**:
- Breeze = gentle, flowing, moving through
- Ridge = elevated, structural, connecting from above

Together, they're the two ways you work in Weave: flowing motion and architectural connection.

**Final answer: Ridge**
