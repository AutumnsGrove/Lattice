# Link-Saving Service — Naming Journey

> *What does the forest do when it needs to retain something?*

---

## The Concept

A link-saving service. Externalized memory. You find things on the internet that
matter to you, and you keep them. Not a passive dump — an intentional act. These
links are IMPORTANT. They're your memory. They're how you find your way back to
things your brain couldn't hold onto.

Reference points:
- **Raindrop.io** — Intentional. Manual tagging. You decide what it is.
  The user LIKES this. The act of categorizing is part of the value.
- **MyMind** — Catch-all. AI does everything. 50 tags per item.
  Too hands-off. Lost the intentionality. But the "anything goes in" is nice.

The sweet spot: **Anything can go in, but YOU decide what it means.**

## What IS saving a link?

Strip it down:
1. You're wandering the internet
2. Something catches you — an article, a tool, a video, a thought
3. You say "I need to remember this"
4. You bring it home
5. You give it a place
6. Weeks later, you reach for it and it's there

It's not archiving. It's not organizing. It's **remembering**.
Your links are your externalized memory.

## What does the forest do when it needs to retain something?

Not "grow around it" — that's too passive, too indifferent.
Not "bury it" — that sounds like hiding, forgetting.

The forest RETAINS. The forest REMEMBERS. How?

### The forest remembers through IMPRINT

A leaf falls on soft mud. It leaves an impression. Seasons pass.
The impression hardens. Millions of years later, you split open a rock
and there it is — perfect, preserved, remembered.

The leaf is gone. The IMPRINT remains.

### The forest remembers through SCENT

A fox marks its territory. A flower's fragrance lingers after it closes.
The forest holds the ghost of what passed through. You walk through
a pine grove and the scent stays on your clothes for hours.
Something WAS here. You can still sense it.

### The forest remembers through SONG

A bird learns its father's song and passes it to its children.
The song persists across generations. It's not written down.
It's not stored. It's CARRIED.

### The forest remembers through GRAIN

Cut a plank of wood and the grain tells you everything.
Where the rain came from. Which years were hard. Where a branch
once grew. The grain is the tree's complete memory, compressed
into pattern. Run your fingers along it. Every line is a story.

### The forest remembers through ETCH

Water drips on stone for a thousand years. A river carves a canyon.
Ice scratches parallel lines across a boulder. The forest ETCHES
its memory into the landscape. Slow, permanent, undeniable.

## Rejected and "close but not quite"

| Name | Why close | Why not |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Cairn | Marking, intentional, "I'll come back" | Cold stones, hiking-coded, not forest |
| Notch | Quick mark, personal, forest-coded | Doesn't resonate sonically |
| Bower | Curation, beauty, personal collection | Doesn't sound right (rejected multiple times) |
| Hollow | Cozy, safe, tucked away | Too much about the CONTAINER, not the ACT |
| Moss | Persistent, remembering | Too passive, no intentionality |
| Drift | Accumulation, layered | Too passive, things just happen to you |

              you reach for it
              it's there

The name lives in one of these moments:
- The act of saving (marking, imprinting, etching)
- The space where things live (the memory itself)
- The act of finding again (reaching, surfacing)

## Direction: What the forest does

The user's guidance: think about the PROCESS. Not grove vocabulary.
Not pretty nature words. What ACTUALLY HAPPENS when the forest retains?

The forest's retention mechanisms:
- **Imprint** — impression left behind
- **Grain** — memory compressed into pattern
- **Etch** — slow, permanent mark carved by repetition
- **Sap** — sticky, catches, hardens into preservation (amber)
- **Spore** — compact, dormant, carries everything needed to regrow
- **Pollen** — sticks to everything, travels, persists
- **Frost** — preserves perfectly, holds in suspension
- **Char** — after fire, the charcoal record remains

## Candidates (abstract, process-focused)

*Testing: does this sound like an externalized memory?*
*Does it feel important, not casual?*
*Does it work as a catch-all?*

### Imprint
A mark pressed into soft ground. Deliberate or natural, but always REAL.
The thing may be gone, but the imprint proves it existed.

- "Save an imprint."
- "Your Imprints."
- "imprint.grove.place"

### Grain
The memory IS the material. Not a tag on something else.
Run your fingers along it. Every line is something that happened.

- "It's in the grain."
- "Your Grain."
- "grain.grove.place"

### Etch
To carve a permanent mark. Not violent — patient. Water etches stone.
Acid etches glass. Time etches the forest floor.

- "Etch it."
- "Your Etchings."
- "etch.grove.place"

### Silt
What settles. What remains after the current passes through.
The river carries everything, but silt stays where it lands.
Layer by layer, it builds a record of what flowed through.

- "Let it silt."
- "Your Silt."
- "silt.grove.place"

### Ember
What remains after the fire. Small, glowing, still alive.
You can rekindle a whole fire from a single ember.
(close to Amber but conceptually different — living vs fossilized)

- "Keep the ember."
- "Your Embers."
- "ember.grove.place"

### Trace
The faintest evidence something was here.
A trace of scent. A trace of a path. You follow traces back.

- "Leave a trace."
- "Your Traces."
- "trace.grove.place"
