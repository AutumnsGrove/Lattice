# Link-Saving Service — Naming Journey

> *What does the forest do when it needs to retain something?*

---

## The Concept

A link-saving service. Externalized memory. You find things on the internet that
matter to you, and you keep them. Not a passive dump — an intentional act. These
links are IMPORTANT. They're your memory. They're how you find your way back to
things your brain couldn't hold onto.

Reference points:
- **Raindrop.io** — Intentional. Manual tagging. You decide what it is.
  The user LIKES this. The act of categorizing is part of the value.
- **MyMind** — Catch-all. AI does everything. 50 tags per item.
  Too hands-off. Lost the intentionality. But the "anything goes in" is nice.

The sweet spot: **Anything can go in, but YOU decide what it means.**

---

## What IS saving a link?

Strip it down:
1. You're wandering the internet
2. Something catches you — an article, a tool, a video, a thought
3. You say "I need to remember this"
4. You bring it home
5. You give it a place
6. Weeks later, you reach for it and it's there

It's not archiving. It's not organizing. It's **remembering**.
Your links are your externalized memory.

## What does the forest do when it needs to retain something?

Not "grow around it" — that's too passive, too indifferent.
Not "bury it" — that sounds like hiding, forgetting.

The forest RETAINS. The forest REMEMBERS. How?

### The forest remembers through IMPRINT

A leaf falls on soft mud. It leaves an impression. Seasons pass.
The impression hardens. Millions of years later, you split open a rock
and there it is — perfect, preserved, remembered.

The leaf is gone. The IMPRINT remains.

### The forest remembers through SCENT

A fox marks its territory. A flower's fragrance lingers after it closes.
The forest holds the ghost of what passed through. You walk through
a pine grove and the scent stays on your clothes for hours.
Something WAS here. You can still sense it.

### The forest remembers through SONG

A bird learns its father's song and passes it to its children.
The song persists across generations. It's not written down.
It's not stored. It's CARRIED.

### The forest remembers through GRAIN

Cut a plank of wood and the grain tells you everything.
Where the rain came from. Which years were hard. Where a branch
once grew. The grain is the tree's complete memory, compressed
into pattern. Run your fingers along it. Every line is a story.

### The forest remembers through ETCH

Water drips on stone for a thousand years. A river carves a canyon.
Ice scratches parallel lines across a boulder. The forest ETCHES
its memory into the landscape. Slow, permanent, undeniable.

## Rejected and "close but not quite"

| Name | Why close | Why not |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Cairn | Marking, intentional, "I'll come back" | Cold stones, hiking-coded, not forest |
| Notch | Quick mark, personal, forest-coded | Doesn't resonate sonically |
| Bower | Curation, beauty, personal collection | Doesn't sound right (rejected multiple times) |
| Hollow | Cozy, safe, tucked away | Too much about the CONTAINER, not the ACT |
| Moss | Persistent, remembering | Too passive, no intentionality |
| Drift | Accumulation, layered | Too passive, things just happen to you |

The name lives in one of these moments:
- The act of saving (marking, imprinting, etching)
- The space where things live (the memory itself)
- The act of finding again (reaching, surfacing)

## Direction: What the forest does

The user's guidance: think about the PROCESS. Not grove vocabulary.
Not pretty nature words. What ACTUALLY HAPPENS when the forest retains?

The forest's retention mechanisms:
- **Imprint** — impression left behind
- **Grain** — memory compressed into pattern
- **Etch** — slow, permanent mark carved by repetition
- **Sap** — sticky, catches, hardens into preservation (amber)
- **Spore** — compact, dormant, carries everything needed to regrow
- **Pollen** — sticks to everything, travels, persists
- **Frost** — preserves perfectly, holds in suspension
- **Char** — after fire, the charcoal record remains

## Candidates (abstract, process-focused)

*Testing: does this sound like an externalized memory?*
*Does it feel important, not casual?*
*Does it work as a catch-all?*

### Imprint
A mark pressed into soft ground. Deliberate or natural, but always REAL.
The thing may be gone, but the imprint proves it existed.

- "Save an imprint."
- "Your Imprints."
- "imprint.grove.place"

### Grain
The memory IS the material. Not a tag on something else.
Run your fingers along it. Every line is something that happened.

- "It's in the grain."
- "Your Grain."
- "grain.grove.place"

### Etch
To carve a permanent mark. Not violent — patient. Water etches stone.
Acid etches glass. Time etches the forest floor.

- "Etch it."
- "Your Etchings."
- "etch.grove.place"

### Silt
What settles. What remains after the current passes through.
The river carries everything, but silt stays where it lands.
Layer by layer, it builds a record of what flowed through.

- "Let it silt."
- "Your Silt."
- "silt.grove.place"

### Ember
What remains after the fire. Small, glowing, still alive.
You can rekindle a whole fire from a single ember.
(close to Amber but conceptually different — living vs fossilized)

- "Keep the ember."
- "Your Embers."
- "ember.grove.place"

### Trace
The faintest evidence something was here.
A trace of scent. A trace of a path. You follow traces back.

- "Leave a trace."
- "Your Traces."
- "trace.grove.place"

## The Moment It Clicked

The user said: "etch is actually REALLY good. I'd LOVE to etch things down.
Especially because we REALLY NEED to have the ability to HIGHLIGHT things
on text. Take down our etchings."

It clicked because:
1. **"Etch it down"** — natural verb phrase, like "jot it down" but more permanent
2. **Scoring/highlighting** maps perfectly to the printmaking metaphor — you
   score the plate, the grooves hold ink, the marks become visible
3. The intentionality is built into the word — you don't accidentally etch
4. It's patient, permanent, and YOURS — matches the emotional need
5. The lexicon writes itself: Plates, Grooves, Scores, Proofs, Bites

## The Name: Etch

**Link Saving & Highlights** · `etch.grove.place`

Water drips on limestone for a thousand years and carves a cave. A glacier
scores parallel grooves into bedrock. In printmaking, you score a plate with
intention—every mark deliberate, every groove holding ink. Etching isn't
violent. It's patient. And what it leaves behind is permanent.

Etch is your externalized memory. Save any link, highlight any text, carve
out what counts. Patient, permanent, yours.

*"Etch is where you carve out what matters."*

## How We Got Here

1. Started with the librarian metaphor (user's instinct) — too institutional
2. Tried grove vocabulary (Bower, Hollow, Moss, etc.) — too pretty, too passive
3. User redirected: "think about what the forest DOES when it retains"
4. Explored forest retention processes: imprint, grain, etch, trace, ember
5. "Etch" resonated immediately — the verb, the intentionality, the highlighting connection
6. Lexicon fell into place naturally from the printmaking metaphor

The walk took us through the forest floor, past the pretty names, past the
containers and creatures, all the way down to the fundamental processes of
retention. The name was in the process, not the place.

*The name you're looking for is already there. You just have to walk until you find it.*
