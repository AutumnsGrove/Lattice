# Voice Transcription Naming Journey

> *Finding the name for Grove's voice-to-text feature*

Started: January 25, 2026

---

## The Problem

We need a name for voice transcription in Grove. Wanderers speak into their device, and their words become text in Flow mode (the markdown editor).

**What it's NOT:**
- "Echo" — rejected. Echoes are hollow repetitions. Also "echo chamber" vibes.
- "Murmur" — too delicate, too wispy. Needs more substance.

**Technical reality:**
- Browser records audio via MediaRecorder API
- Audio sent to Lumen (AI gateway)
- Lumen routes to Cloudflare Workers AI Whisper
- Transcribed text returned and inserted at cursor

But the name isn't about the tech. It's about the experience.

## Visualizing the Grove

```
                              ☀️

                    🌲    🌳    🌲    🌲
                 🌲    🌲    🌳    🌲
              🌲    🌳    🌲    🌲    🌳
           🌲    🌲    🌲    🌳    🌲    🌲

                ROOTS CONNECT BENEATH
                 (Lumen routes AI)
```

**Where things live:**
- **Meadow** — the open social space (center clearing)
- **Heartwood** — core identity (deep in the tree)
- **Arbor** — where you tend your tree (admin)
- **Flow mode** — where you write (inside Arbor)
- **Lumen** — the hollow through which AI flows (underground)
- **Wisp** — writing assistant (a light that guides)
- **Fireside** — conversation mode of Wisp (warmth, talking)

Voice transcription lives... where?

It's part of Flow mode. It's how you input text without typing.
It's related to Wisp (writing help) but it's not AI generation.
It passes through Lumen but isn't Lumen itself.

---

## What IS This Thing?

### Fundamentally:
- It's **capturing spoken words** and making them permanent
- It's **transformation** — ephemeral voice becomes lasting text
- It's **flow** — thoughts moving from mind → voice → page
- It's **listening** — the grove hears you and remembers

### What it does for a Wanderer:
- Removes typing friction
- Captures thoughts before they escape
- Enables writing while mobile, walking, lying down
- Accessibility for those who can't type easily
- Makes the blank page less intimidating

### The emotion it should evoke:
- **Natural** — like talking to yourself while walking
- **Substantial** — your words matter, they're being captured
- **Grounded** — not floaty or ethereal
- **Warm** — the grove is listening, not a machine

---

## Walking Through the Forest

I enter the grove at dusk. The day's thoughts are still buzzing.

I walk past the Meadow where others are gathered, sharing.
I find my tree — my blog, my space.
I climb into Arbor, open Flow mode.

The blank page waits.

I don't want to type. My hands are tired. Or I'm on my phone.
Or the words just... they come out better when I talk.

I look around Flow mode. What do I reach for?

There's Wisp — but Wisp helps me edit, refine, polish.
There's Fireside — but Fireside is a conversation, back-and-forth.

This is different. I just want to **speak** and have the grove **remember**.

What do I see? What's the tool?

---

## Rejected Directions

### Too Delicate / Ethereal
- **Murmur** — too soft, wispy, insubstantial
- **Whisper** — also the model name (Whisper AI), confusing
- **Breath** — too abstract, too biological
- **Mist** — evaporates, doesn't feel permanent
- **Zephyr** — too fancy, too Greek

### Too Technical / Cold
- **Transcribe** — clinical
- **Dictate** — corporate, secretary vibes
- **Record** — generic, no soul

### Already Taken or Conflicting
- **Echo** — "echo chamber" negative, also just repetition
- **Breeze** — already Breeze mode in Terrarium
- **Clearing** — already the status page

### Wrong Vibe
- **Lark** — too playful, "larking about"
- **Chatter** — negative connotation, trivial
- **Chirp** — too small, too cute
- **Warble** — unsteady, uncertain

---

## Exploring New Directions

### Theme: Things That LISTEN in Nature

The grove listens. What in nature listens?

- **Owls** — silent hunters, all-hearing... but predatory
- **Rabbits** — ears always twitching... but prey animals
- **The forest floor** — absorbs all sound
- **A still pond** — receives everything, reflects

What about things that **receive** sound and **hold** it?

### Theme: Transformation (Voice → Text)

What in nature transforms one thing into another?

- **Amber** — already taken (storage), but: resin becomes stone
- **Chrysalis** — caterpillar becomes butterfly
- **Frost** — water vapor becomes visible pattern
- **Dew** — invisible moisture becomes visible drops
- **Sap** — flows, carries nutrients, becomes something else

### Theme: Sound Becoming Permanent

- **Groove** — literally what records hold sound (vinyl grooves)
- **Carve** — sound carved into wax, into wood
- **Etch** — already taken (link saving)
- **Press** — already taken (image processing)
- **Score** — marking, recording... also music

### Theme: Natural Sound That Has Substance

Not whispers. Not murmurs. What sounds in nature have WEIGHT?

- **Thunder** — too aggressive
- **Roar** — too loud
- **Call** — bird calls, animal calls... purposeful sound
- **Cry** — too sad
- **Song** — has substance... "Songbird" is the injection protection though
- **Tone** — too clinical
- **Hum** — steady, continuous, grounded... interesting

### Theme: Receiving and Keeping

- **Vessel** — receives and holds
- **Basin** — catches water, holds it
- **Well** — deep, receives, stores
- **Catch** — catching words like catching rain

---

## Candidates Round 2

### 1. **Hum**
A hum is steady, grounded, continuous. Not delicate — it has resonance. You can hum while you work. Bees hum. Machines hum. It's substantial.

> "Hum your thoughts into existence."

But... "hum" might be too mechanical? Power lines hum. Refrigerators hum.

### 2. **Call**
A call is purposeful sound. Bird calls. A call across the valley. You're calling out your thoughts and they're being received.

> "Call your words into the grove."

But... might feel too loud, too urgent.

### 3. **Grove** (verb)
Wait — can we verb the name itself? "Grove your thoughts"? No, that's confusing.

### 4. **Canopy**
The canopy receives all the sound of the forest. It's overhead, encompassing.

> "Speak to the canopy. Watch your words descend."

Interesting but maybe too abstract.

### 5. **Catch**
You catch your thoughts before they escape. Simple, active verb.

> "Catch your thoughts before they fly."

But "catch" isn't very nature-specific. Could be anything.

### 6. **Root** (verb)
Your spoken words take root, become permanent.

> "Root your voice in the page."

Hmm. "Root" as verb is nice but might confuse with "Rooted" (subscriber identity).

### 7. **Settle**
Like sediment settling. Your words settle onto the page.

> "Let your thoughts settle."

Maybe too passive?

### 8. **Perch**
Where a bird lands to sing. A vantage point. Your words perch on the page.

> "Find your perch. Speak."

But "perch" is also a fish. And it's where you ARE, not what you DO.

### 9. **Alight**
Birds alight on branches. Your words alight on the page.

> "Speak, and watch your words alight."

Beautiful but maybe too delicate still?

### 10. **Roost**
Where birds come home to rest. Your words find their roost.

> "Your voice finds its roost."

Hmm. Roost has connotations of sleeping, ending the day.

---

## Going Deeper: What's the Core Action?

Strip away the poetry. What is the Wanderer DOING?

1. **Speaking** — primary action
2. **Being heard** — the grove receives their voice
3. **Words appearing** — transformation happens
4. **Text remains** — permanence

The magic moment is: **the grove hears you and writes it down.**

What in nature does this? What HEARS and RECORDS?

- **Rings** — trees record their history in rings... but Rings is taken (analytics)
- **Bark** — trees wear their history... but bark doesn't listen
- **Stone** — receives carvings, holds them... but stone doesn't listen

What if the metaphor is about WHERE you speak, not what happens after?

---

## Theme: Places Where Speaking Feels Natural

In the grove, where do you go to speak and be heard?

- **A clearing** — taken
- **A hollow** — resonant, transforms sound
- **A glade** — open, quiet, sound carries
- **A dell** — small valley, intimate
- **A bower** — shaded shelter, private
- **A cove** — sheltered inlet... more water than forest
- **A nook** — taken (video sharing)
- **A den** — animal home, cozy... but too hidden?

### Hollow (Revisited)

A hollow tree trunk. You speak into it. Your voice resonates and becomes something else.

Connects to Lumen — "the hollow center of a tube."

> "Speak into the Hollow."

But "hollow" has negative connotations — empty, meaningless.

### Glen

A glen is a narrow valley. Scottish/Irish origin. Intimate, enclosed by hills.

> "In the Glen, your voice carries."

Nice but maybe too place-oriented? And not everyone knows "glen."

### Vale

A vale is a valley, often with a stream. Poetic.

> "Speak to the Vale."

Too archaic?

### Copse

A small group of trees. Intimate gathering.

> "In the Copse, speak freely."

Most people don't know "copse."

---

## Theme: The Act of Voice Becoming Permanent

What if the name is about the transformation itself?

- **Imprint** — your voice leaves an imprint
- **Trace** — your voice leaves a trace (but Trace is part of Weave)
- **Mark** — simple, direct
- **Cast** — casting your voice, like casting a spell

### Cast

You cast your voice into the grove. Casting also relates to:
- Casting a fishing line
- Casting a spell
- Casting shadows
- Cast of characters

> "Cast your voice. Watch it land."

This has substance! Not delicate. Active verb.

### Imprint

Your voice leaves an imprint on the page.

> "Imprint your voice."

Also substantial. But maybe too clinical?

---

## Theme: Natural Sound with Weight

What sounds in nature are SUBSTANTIAL, not wispy?

- **Thrum** — the deep vibration of a hive, of wings
- **Drone** — steady, deep sound... but negative connotations
- **Toll** — bells toll... too heavy, funereal
- **Peal** — bells peal... celebratory but not forest
- **Ring** — taken
- **Chime** — too delicate

### Thrum

A thrum is a low, continuous vibration. Hummingbird wings thrum. A beehive thrums. Guitar strings thrum.

> "Thrum your thoughts into being."

This has WEIGHT. It's not delicate. It's resonant and alive.

### Drone

A drone is a continuous low sound. But "drone" now means flying robots, and also boring speech.

Probably not.

---

## Candidates Round 3 (Substantial Ones)

| Name | Meaning | Vibe | Concern |
|------|---------|------|---------|
| **Cast** | Throw your voice out | Active, magical, substantial | Maybe too aggressive? |
| **Thrum** | Deep continuous vibration | Resonant, alive, grounded | Uncommon word |
| **Catch** | Capture thoughts | Simple, active | Not nature-specific |
| **Settle** | Words settle on page | Grounded, calm | Too passive? |
| **Alight** | Words land gently | Beautiful, precise | Still a bit delicate? |
| **Glen** | Intimate valley | Place-oriented, Scottish | Not everyone knows it |
| **Imprint** | Leave a mark | Permanent, substantial | Maybe too clinical |

---

## Testing Taglines

**Cast**
> "Cast your voice into the grove."
> "Cast is where speaking becomes writing."
> "Cast your thoughts. Watch them land."

**Thrum**
> "Thrum your thoughts into being."
> "The grove thrums with voices becoming words."
> "Thrum is the vibration of voice becoming text."

**Catch**
> "Catch your thoughts before they fly."
> "Catch is where the grove catches your voice."

**Settle**
> "Let your words settle."
> "Settle is where spoken thoughts find their place."

**Alight**
> "Speak, and watch your words alight."
> "Alight is where voice lands on the page."

---

## New Direction: The Listener

What if the feature is named after WHAT LISTENS, not what you do?

In the grove, what listens?

- **The Owl** — hears everything, sees in darkness
- **The Earth** — receives all sound
- **The Bark** — witness to everything
- **The Moss** — soft, absorbs, remembers

### Moss

Moss is soft but substantial. It covers everything. It absorbs sound. It's been here longer than the trees. Moss remembers.

> "Speak to the Moss."
> "Moss is where the grove listens."
> "The Moss hears. The Moss remembers."

I like this. Moss is:
- Soft but NOT delicate — it survives everything
- Ancient — older than trees
- Absorbent — takes in sound, moisture, everything
- Quiet but present — it's always there
- Grounded — literally on the ground, on bark, on stone

---

## Testing "Moss"

**As a feature name:**
> "Use Moss to speak your post into existence."
> "Enable Moss in Flow mode."
> "Moss: voice to text for the grove."

**Taglines:**
> "Speak to the Moss. It remembers."
> "Moss is where the grove listens."
> "The softest things remember longest."

**The entry:**
```
### Moss
**Voice Transcription** · *Integrated into Flow mode*

Moss is soft but it survives everything. It covers forest floors,
climbs tree bark, cushions stones. It absorbs sound, absorbs
moisture, absorbs time itself. Moss has been listening since
before the oldest tree took root.

Moss is voice transcription for Grove. Speak your thoughts and
watch them appear on the page. No typing. No friction. The Moss
hears you. The Moss remembers. Integrated through Lumen, running
at the edge — nothing to download, nothing to install.

*The softest things remember longest.*
```

---

## Alternative: Loam?

Wait — Loam is taken (name protection). Never mind.

---

## Alternative: Peat?

Peat is compressed moss, organic matter built up over centuries. It preserves things perfectly — bog bodies, ancient seeds. Peat remembers for millennia.

> "Speak to the Peat. It preserves."

But "peat" might be too obscure? And peat bogs are kind of... wet and dark.

---

## Alternative: Lichen?

Lichen is ancient, symbiotic, survives anywhere. But lichen doesn't really "listen."

---

## Alternative: Fern?

Ferns unfurl. Your words unfurl on the page. But ferns don't listen either.

---

## Coming Back to Verbs

Maybe the name should be a VERB, something you DO.

**What do you do when you speak to the grove?**

- You **speak** — too generic
- You **tell** — too generic
- You **voice** — interesting as verb? "Voice your thoughts"
- You **utter** — too formal
- You **say** — too generic
- You **pour** — you pour out your thoughts...

### Pour

You pour your thoughts out. They flow onto the page. Like pouring water, pouring yourself into something.

> "Pour your thoughts onto the page."
> "Pour is where voice becomes text."

"Pour" is active, substantial, natural (water pours), and emotional (pouring your heart out).

But... it's not particularly forest-themed.

### Spill

Similar to pour but more accidental. Probably not.

---

## What About "Speak"?

The simplest option. Just call it **Speak**.

> "Use Speak in Flow mode."
> "Speak your post into existence."

It's direct. It's what you do. But is it too generic? Not Grove-y enough?

---

## Combining Ideas

What if we combine the act with the nature element?

- **Mosscast** — casting voice to moss... too clunky
- **Fernspeak** — no
- **Rootvoice** — no

These don't work. Compound names feel forced.

---

## Current Top Candidates

After all this exploration:

1. **Moss** — the grove listens, soft but substantial, remembers
2. **Cast** — active, magical, throwing your voice out
3. **Thrum** — resonant, deep, alive
4. **Pour** — emotional, flowing, substantial (but not forest-y)

---

## Decision Point

I need to step back. What's the VIBE we want?

**Option A: The Grove Listens (Moss)**
- Passive, receptive
- Ancient, patient
- "Speak to the Moss"
- Gentle but substantial

**Option B: You Project Your Voice (Cast)**
- Active, intentional
- Magical, transformative
- "Cast your voice"
- Powerful but grounded

**Option C: Deep Resonance (Thrum)**
- Vibrational, alive
- Substantial, continuous
- "Thrum your thoughts"
- Unusual but memorable

Which fits Grove better?

Grove is about **warmth**, **home**, **your space**.

The grove doesn't demand. It receives. It welcomes.

That suggests **Moss** — the grove is listening, ready to receive.

But the USER is also active. They're choosing to speak. They're creating.

That suggests **Cast** — you're actively throwing your voice into the world.

---

## Let Me Walk One More Time

I'm in Flow mode. Blank page. I want to speak instead of type.

I press the button.

Am I "casting" my voice? Am I speaking "to the Moss"? Am I "thrumming"?

What feels natural?

"I'm going to **cast** this post." — Feels like magic, intentional
"I'm going to **moss** this post." — Weird as verb
"I'm going to **thrum** this post." — Awkward

But as a feature:
"Enable **Cast** to speak your posts." — Clear
"Enable **Moss** to speak your posts." — Sounds like a weird plugin
"Enable **Thrum** to speak your posts." — Unusual

Hmm. **Cast** works better as an action-oriented feature name.

But what about the NOUN form?

"I recorded that using **Cast**." — Sounds like podcast, Chromecast
"I recorded that using **Moss**." — Sounds natural, Grove-y
"I recorded that using **Thrum**." — Sounds unique

---

## Plot Twist: What About "Speak" But Grove-ified?

What's the Grove word for speaking?

In the forest:
- Birds **sing**
- Wolves **howl**
- Owls **hoot**
- Wind **whispers** through trees
- Streams **babble**
- Thunder **rumbles**

What do TREES do? Trees don't speak... but:
- Leaves **rustle**
- Branches **creak**
- Roots **reach**

What about **Rustle**?

Rustle is:
- The sound of leaves, of movement
- Substantial — you hear rustling, something is there
- Forest-native
- Active — things rustle, cause rustling

> "Rustle up a post."
> "Use Rustle to speak your thoughts."
> "Rustle: voice for the grove."

**Testing the tagline:**
> "Rustle is where your voice stirs the leaves."
> "Speak, and let the words rustle onto the page."

Hmm. "Rustle" is interesting but might have connotations of:
- Rustling cattle (stealing)
- Rustling up (finding/making quickly) — actually this works!
- Rustling leaves — natural

"Rustle up a post" — this actually works colloquially AND fits the nature theme.

---

## Updated Top Candidates

1. **Moss** — the grove listens, patient receiver
2. **Cast** — you project your voice, active and magical
3. **Rustle** — the sound of the forest responding to your voice
4. **Thrum** — deep resonance, substantial vibration

---

## User Feedback (Round 1)

**Liked:** The VIBE of Moss — patient, ancient, receptive, the grove listens
**Problem:** None of the names work well in a sentence
**Exception:** Rustle works in a sentence ("rustle up a post") but vibe isn't quite right

**Direction:** Keep the Moss vibe (patient listener, ancient, substantial) but find something that works as a natural verb/action.

---

## Walking Deeper: The Patient Listener

So I need something that:
1. Has the vibe of moss — ancient, patient, absorbent, always there
2. Works naturally in a sentence — "I'll _____ this post"
3. Feels substantial, not delicate
4. Is Grove-native (forest/nature)

What else in the forest LISTENS and RECEIVES like moss does?

### The Forest Floor

The forest floor receives everything:
- Fallen leaves
- Seeds
- Rain
- Footsteps
- Sound

What words describe the forest floor's action?

- **Gather** — the floor gathers fallen things
- **Receive** — too formal
- **Hold** — the floor holds everything
- **Keep** — the floor keeps what falls
- **Catch** — the floor catches rain, leaves

**Gather** is interesting:
> "Gather your thoughts into a post."
> "I'll gather this while I walk."
> "Gather: where the grove collects your voice."

But "gather" might be too generic? Not forest-specific enough?

### Things That Absorb

What absorbs in nature?

- Moss absorbs
- Soil absorbs
- Roots absorb
- Sponges absorb (not forest)
- Peat absorbs

What's the VERB for what moss does?

Moss doesn't just sit there. It:
- **Drinks** — moss drinks moisture from the air
- **Draws** — moss draws in water
- **Takes** — moss takes what it needs
- **Soaks** — moss soaks up rain

**Soak** is interesting:
> "Soak in your thoughts."
> "Let the grove soak up your voice."
> "Soak: voice absorbed into text."

But "soak" feels wet, not quite right for voice.

### The Listening Earth

What if the metaphor is the earth itself listening?

- **Ground** — your voice is grounded, becomes real
- **Root** — your voice takes root (but "Rooted" is subscriber identity)
- **Earth** — too big, too generic
- **Soil** — receives seeds, receives everything

**Ground** as a verb:
> "Ground your thoughts."
> "I'll ground this idea in a post."

This has nice double meaning:
- Grounded = made real, substantial
- Grounded = connected to earth
- Grounding = calming, centering

But is "ground" too generic? Not Grove-y enough?

### Ancient Things That Listen

What's been listening in the forest for a very long time?

- **Stone** — stones have heard everything
- **Roots** — roots listen through the soil
- **Stumps** — old stumps have witnessed centuries
- **Hollows** — hollow trees hold sound

What about **Stump**?

A stump is what remains. It's been there. It's witnessed everything. You sit on a stump and talk.

> "I'll stump this out." — No, doesn't work.

Stump doesn't verb well.

### What About the Action of Settling?

When you speak, your words settle onto the page. Like sediment. Like leaves settling on the forest floor.

**Settle**:
> "Let your thoughts settle."
> "I'll settle this into a post."
> "Settle: where voice finds its place."

"Settle" has good connotations:
- Settling down (calming)
- Settlers (finding home)
- Sediment settling (becoming permanent)
- Settling into place (finding where you belong)

But "settle" might be too passive? And "I'll settle this into a post" is awkward.

### What About the Sound of Settling?

When leaves fall and settle, what's the sound?

- A soft **hush**
- A gentle **sift**
- A quiet **rest**

**Sift**:
> "Sift your thoughts into words."
> "I'll sift this out."
> "Sift: voice filtered into text."

Sifting is:
- Separating, clarifying
- Gentle but purposeful
- What you do with flour, with soil, with ideas

But sifting implies FILTERING, removing things. That's not quite right for transcription.

### Back to Listening: What Hears in the Forest?

Not just moss. What else?

- **Ferns** — ferns unfurl toward sound? No, that's light.
- **Lichens** — ancient, symbiotic, but don't listen
- **Bark** — trees are wrapped in bark, bark is the skin that feels

What about **Bark**?

Bark is:
- The tree's interface with the world
- Protective but sensitive
- Textured, substantial
- Where you'd carve a message

> "Bark your thoughts." — No, that's dog barking.

Doesn't work.

### The Bed of the Forest

The forest floor is sometimes called:
- The **duff** — layer of decomposing matter
- The **litter** — fallen leaves and debris
- The **bed** — the soft bed of needles

**Bed** doesn't work (too many meanings).

**Duff** is interesting but obscure.

What about **Litter** in the forestry sense? No, too much trash connotation.

### What About Nesting?

Birds nest. Ideas nest. You nest your thoughts.

**Nest**:
> "Nest your thoughts into a post."
> "I'll nest this idea."
> "Nest: where your voice finds home."

Nest is:
- Cozy, protected
- Building something
- Home-making
- Natural

But "nest" might be too cute? And nesting is about BUILDING, not about being received/heard.

### Burrow?

Burrow is taken (cross-property access).

### What About Lodge?

Animals lodge in the forest. Beavers build lodges. To lodge something is to place it firmly.

**Lodge**:
> "Lodge your thoughts."
> "I'll lodge this post."
> "Lodge: where your voice takes hold."

Lodge means:
- To place firmly
- To deposit
- A beaver's home
- A cabin in the woods

> "I'll lodge this complaint" — formal usage
> "The bullet lodged in the tree" — stuck, permanent

"Lodge your thoughts" works! It's:
- Substantial (things that lodge are stuck, permanent)
- Natural (lodges in the forest)
- Active verb that makes sense
- Not delicate at all

Let me test it:

> "Lodge your voice into the grove."
> "Lodge: speak and let it stick."
> "I'll lodge this while I'm walking."

Hmm. "Lodge" might be too formal? "Lodge a complaint" vibes?

### What About the Softer Version: Rest?

When you rest something somewhere, it stays.

**Rest**:
> "Rest your thoughts on the page."
> "I'll rest this here."
> "Rest: where your voice finds peace."

But "rest" implies sleep, ending. Not quite the active creation of a post.

### Let Me Try Animal Actions

What do forest animals do that relates to listening/receiving/keeping?

- Squirrels **stash** — they stash acorns
- Bears **den** — they den for winter
- Birds **roost** — they settle in for night
- Deer **bed** — they bed down in grass
- Foxes **cache** — they cache food

**Stash**:
> "Stash your thoughts."
> "I'll stash this post."
> "Stash: quick capture for later."

Stash is:
- Quick, informal
- Keeping for later
- Squirrel energy
- Active, natural

But "stash" might be too casual? And implies hiding, not publishing.

### What About the Way Seeds Work?

Seeds fall, land, and eventually grow. Your voice is like a seed.

- **Sow** — you sow seeds
- **Scatter** — too chaotic
- **Plant** — Plant is taken (onboarding)
- **Seed** — noun, awkward as verb

**Sow**:
> "Sow your thoughts."
> "I'll sow this post."
> "Sow: plant your voice and watch it grow."

Sow is:
- Agricultural, natural
- Intentional
- About future growth
- Substantial

> "Sow your thoughts into the grove."

This is pretty good! Let me test more:

> "I'll sow this while I walk." — Works!
> "Use Sow to speak your posts." — Works!
> "Sow: where voice takes root." — Nice connection to "Rooted"!

**Concern:** "Sow" sounds like "so" when spoken. Could be confusing verbally.

### What About Bury/Plant Adjacent?

- **Tuck** — you tuck something in, safe and snug
- **Lay** — you lay something down
- **Set** — too generic
- **Place** — too generic

**Tuck**:
> "Tuck your thoughts into a post."
> "I'll tuck this away."
> "Tuck: nestle your voice into the grove."

Tuck is:
- Cozy (tuck in at night)
- Protective
- Gentle but not weak
- Natural action

> "I'll tuck this thought into a post while I walk."

This feels warm! Very Grove-y.

But is "tuck" substantial enough? It's gentle...

### What About the Sound the Forest Makes When It Receives?

When rain falls on the forest canopy, what's the sound?

- A **patter**
- A **hush**
- A **sigh**

When wind moves through trees:

- A **sigh**
- A **hush**
- A **whoosh**

**Sigh**:
> "Sigh your thoughts into being."

No, sighing is too melancholy.

### Wait — What About "Hush"?

Hush is interesting because it means BOTH:
- Silence (hush, be quiet)
- A soft sound (the hush of wind)

> "Hush your thoughts onto the page."

No, "hush" as a verb means to silence someone. Wrong direction.

### Let Me Try: Words for Natural Deposits

When rivers slow down, sediment **settles**.
When leaves fall, they **gather**.
When snow falls, it **blankets** or **covers**.
When dew forms, it **collects**.

**Collect**:
> "Collect your thoughts."
> "I'll collect this into a post."

Too generic, not forest-y.

### What About the Slow Accumulation?

Moss grows slowly. Rings accumulate slowly. What's the word for slow, patient accumulation?

- **Accrue** — too financial
- **Gather** — still considering
- **Amass** — too aggressive
- **Build** — too generic
- **Grow** — too generic
- **Accrete** — geological, interesting but obscure

### Forest Time Words

- **Season** — a season of posts? Doesn't verb well.
- **Ring** — taken (analytics)
- **Layer** — layers build up...

**Layer**:
> "Layer your thoughts."
> "I'll layer this in."

Not quite right either.

### New Angle: What's the Moment of Capture?

The instant your voice becomes text. What is that moment?

- A **catch**
- A **take**
- A **hold**
- A **keep**

**Keep**:
> "Keep your thoughts."
> "I'll keep this."
> "Keep: the grove remembers what you say."

Keep is:
- Simple
- Implies permanence
- "Keep" as in a castle keep (stronghold)
- "Beekeeping" — tending, caring for

> "I'll keep this thought."
> "Use Keep to save your voice."

But "keep" might be too close to generic "save" or "store"?

### What About "Hold"?

The grove holds your voice.

**Hold**:
> "Hold this thought."
> "I'll hold this in a post."
> "Hold: the grove holds what you say."

"Hold this thought" is already a phrase! That's good!
But "hold" might be too temporary? "Hold" implies you'll let go later.

### The Grove as Witness

What if the grove is witnessing, not just receiving?

- **Witness** — too formal/legal
- **Heed** — the grove heeds your voice
- **Hear** — too simple
- **Mark** — the grove marks what you say

**Heed**:
> "The grove heeds your voice."
> "Heed: speak and be heard."

"Heed" is old-fashioned, has weight. But as a feature name?

> "I'll heed this post." — Doesn't work as action.

Heed doesn't verb well from the user's perspective.

### Turning Point: User as Speaker vs Grove as Receiver

Maybe the name should be from the GROVE's perspective, not the user's?

The grove:
- **Hears**
- **Heeds**
- **Holds**
- **Keeps**
- **Gathers**
- **Receives**

What if the feature is named after what the GROVE does?

**Hark** — "Hark!" means listen. Old English.
> "Hark: the grove is listening."
> "Use Hark to speak your post."

"Hark" is:
- Ancient, substantial
- Means "listen!"
- Forest-y (hark, in the forest)
- Unusual but recognizable

> "I'll hark this post." — Doesn't quite work.

But as a noun/feature name:
> "Enable Hark in Flow mode."
> "Hark: speak and be heard."
> "Hark is where the grove listens."

**Hark** has the ancient, patient vibe of Moss, but it's about LISTENING, which is exactly what this feature is about from the grove's perspective.

### Testing "Hark"

**As a feature:**
> "Hark is voice transcription for Grove."
> "Enable Hark to speak your posts."
> "With Hark, the grove listens."

**As a command/action:**
> "I'll use Hark for this post." — Works
> "Hark this for me." — Awkward but possible
> "Record with Hark." — Works

**Taglines:**
> "Hark: the grove is listening."
> "Speak. The grove harks."
> "Hark! Your voice, remembered."

**The entry:**
```
### Hark
**Voice Transcription** · *Integrated into Flow mode*

"Hark!" — the old word for "listen." A call to attention.
Before radio, before recording, if you wanted someone to
hear you, you called out and hoped they would hark.

Hark is the grove listening. Speak your thoughts and the
grove hears, transcribes, remembers. No typing, no friction—
just your voice and a patient listener that never forgets.
The oldest kind of magic: being heard.

*Hark! The grove is listening.*
```

## Other Candidates in This Direction

If we're going with "the grove listens" vibe:

### Heed
> "The grove heeds your voice."
More formal than hark, similar meaning.

### Hearken
Full form of hark. "Hearken to my words."
But might be TOO archaic.

### Attend
"The grove attends to your voice."
Too formal, too servant-y.

### List (archaic)
"List!" was another old word for "listen."
"The grove lists to your voice."
But "list" has too many modern meanings.

---

## Current Top Candidates (Round 2)

1. **Hark** — "Hark! The grove is listening." Ancient, patient, substantial.
2. **Sow** — "Sow your thoughts." Agricultural, growth-oriented. (But sounds like "so")
3. **Tuck** — "Tuck your thoughts in." Cozy, warm, protective.
4. **Keep** — "Keep your thoughts." Simple, permanent.
5. **Lodge** — "Lodge your voice." Firm, stuck, substantial.

---

## Gut Check on "Hark"

**Pros:**
- Ancient word, substantial feel
- Literally means "listen" — which is what the grove does
- Works as a feature name
- Unusual but recognizable
- Has the Moss vibe (patient listener) but more active
- "Hark! The grove is listening" is a great tagline

**Cons:**
- Doesn't work great as a verb from user perspective
- "Hark this post" is awkward
- Might feel too Shakespearean/Renaissance Faire?

**The question:** Is it okay that the name is from the GROVE's perspective rather than the user's action?

Wisp = the helper (grove's perspective)
Thorn = the protector (grove's perspective)
Rings = the record (grove's perspective)

So yes, naming from grove's perspective is valid!

---

## User Feedback (Round 2)

**Sow** — Likes the vibe, but homophone problem is real (even dictation corrects to "so")
**Keep** — Likes it, but Google Keep exists. Also feels generic.
**None of these are singing yet.**

**New direction:** Stop focusing on "talking to the blog." Think about what **writing a blog actually means**.

---

## Reframe: What IS Writing a Blog?

Forget voice-to-text mechanics. What are you DOING when you write?

### The Act of Writing

1. You have something inside (thoughts, ideas, feelings)
2. You make it external (put it into words)
3. You put it somewhere others can find it
4. It persists over time
5. It becomes part of your story

### The Emotional Core

Writing a blog is:
- **Leaving a mark** — "I was here. This is what I thought."
- **Creating a path** — others might follow your thinking
- **Making permanent** — thoughts that would fade, now persist
- **Expressing yourself** — your voice (metaphorically), your perspective

### What Nature Metaphors Fit THIS?

Not listening/receiving (that's the grove's side).
What about the WRITER'S side? The act of MARKING, CREATING, PATH-MAKING?

## New Direction: Trail Blazing

In the forest, how do you mark your path?

**Trail Blazing** — You cut marks into tree bark. Each blaze says "I was here. This is the way." Others follow your blazes.

### BLAZE

A blaze is a mark cut into bark. Trail blazers mark trees to create paths through wilderness.

> "Blaze your thoughts."
> "I'll blaze this while I walk."
> "Blaze your trail through the grove."

**Testing:**

**As a feature:**
> "Blaze is voice transcription for Grove."
> "Enable Blaze to speak your posts."
> "Use Blaze in Flow mode."

**In sentences:**
> "I'll blaze this thought while I walk." — Works!
> "Let me blaze this before I forget." — Natural!
> "I blazed the whole thing." — Works!

**Taglines:**
> "Blaze your trail through the grove."
> "Blaze: mark your path with voice."
> "Speak. Blaze. The path appears."

**Why it works:**
- Forest-native (trail blazing is real)
- Substantial, active (you're MAKING something)
- About permanence (blazes last)
- About path-making (writing IS creating a trail of thought)
- Connects to Trails feature naturally
- Works great as verb in sentences

**The entry:**
```
### Blaze
**Voice Transcription** · *Integrated into Flow mode*

A blaze is a mark cut into tree bark—the trail marker that
guides those who follow. Before GPS, before maps, travelers
blazed trails through wilderness. Each mark said: I was here.
This is the way.

Blaze is voice transcription for Grove. Speak your thoughts
and watch them mark the page. No typing, no friction—just
your voice blazing a trail through the blank page. Every
word a mark. Every post a path.

*Blaze your trail. Others might follow.*
```

**Potential concern:** "Blaze" has cannabis culture associations ("420 blaze it"). In Grove's forest context, the trail-blazing meaning should be clear, but worth considering.

---

## Alternative: CATCH

If Blaze feels wrong, what about the moment of CAPTURE?

Your thoughts fly by. You catch them before they're gone.

> "Catch your thoughts."
> "I'll catch this while I walk."
> "Catch: grab your voice before it flies."

**Why it works:**
- Active, quick
- Like catching fireflies, catching falling leaves
- "Catch" works naturally in sentences
- Simple, direct

**Why it might not work:**
- Not specifically forest-y
- Generic

---

## Alternative: SCRIBE

A scribe writes down what is spoken. The grove becomes your scribe.

> "Scribe your thoughts."
> "I'll scribe this out."
> "Scribe: the grove writes what you speak."

**Why it works:**
- Direct connection to transcription
- Historical weight

**Why it might not work:**
- Medieval/monk vibes
- Not forest-native

---

## Current Top Candidate: BLAZE

**Blaze** has:
- Authentic forest roots (trail blazing)
- Action and substance (not delicate)
- Path-making meaning (writing = creating a trail)
- Natural connection to Trails feature
- Works beautifully in sentences
- Strong tagline: "Blaze your trail"

---

## Other Quick Candidates

| Name | Meaning | Sentence Test | Vibe |
|------|---------|---------------|------|
| **Mark** | Leave your mark | "I'll mark this down" | Generic but solid |
| **Score** | Cut a mark | "I'll score this thought" | Also music (score) |
| **Notch** | Cut in wood | "I'll notch this" | A bit awkward |
| **Trace** | Leave a trace | Taken (part of Weave) | — |
| **Etch** | Carve in | Taken (link saving) | — |

## THE NAME: SCRIBE

**User:** "Scribe !!! I saw you say scribe in there and scribe is the perfect thing. Lock it in!!!"

---

### SCRIBE

A scribe writes down what is spoken. Before keyboards, before typewriters, if you wanted your words preserved, you spoke to a scribe and they wrote.

> "Scribe your thoughts."
> "I'll scribe this while I walk."
> "The grove scribes what you speak."

**Why it's perfect:**

1. **Direct and clear** — A scribe transcribes. That's literally what this does.
2. **Historical weight** — Scribes have existed for millennia. Ancient, substantial.
3. **Works as a verb** — "I'll scribe this" is natural.
4. **The grove as scribe** — Patient, attentive, writing down your words.
5. **Not delicate** — Scribes do important work. They preserve.
6. **Warm** — A scribe is a person helping you, not a machine.

**Taglines:**
> "Scribe: the grove writes what you speak."
> "Speak. The grove scribes."
> "Your voice, scribed."

**The Entry:**

```
### Scribe
**Voice Transcription** · *Integrated into Flow mode*

Before keyboards, before typewriters, before pens were common,
there were scribes. You spoke; they wrote. Your words, preserved
by patient hands. The oldest partnership in writing.

Scribe is voice transcription for Grove. Speak your thoughts
and watch them appear on the page. No typing, no friction—just
your voice and the grove, writing it down. The grove becomes
your scribe: patient, attentive, never missing a word.
