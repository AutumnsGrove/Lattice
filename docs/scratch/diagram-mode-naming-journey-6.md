# Diagram Mode Naming Journey #6: Beach Walk

> Finding the coastal counterpart to **Breeze** (animation mode)

**Date:** January 8th, 2026
**Context:** Weave's diagram sub-mode needs a name
**Direction:** Beach/coastal imagery with VERB energy

---

## The Challenge

**What didn't land:**
- Trace — too passive, generic
- Dew — passive, delicate
- Frost — not action-like
- Ridge — a place, not an action
- Span — too abstract, just two objects
- Sweep — sounds like a broom!

**What we need:**
- A VERB / ACTION feel
- The feeling of CONNECTING everything (not just two points)
- That mountaintop/vista energy but translated to coastal
- Power and presence, not delicacy

**The pairing:**
- **Breeze** — air/wind energy, motion propagating
- **[This]** — water/coastal energy, connections revealing

## What IS the Beach?

Standing on the shore, you see:
- The horizon stretching infinitely
- Water connecting everything (every shore touches the same ocean)
- Tides pulling, reaching, connecting distant lands
- The current beneath the surface, invisible but powerful
- Waves that crash and retreat, revealing what's beneath

**The fundamental feeling:**
> When you stand at the beach looking out, you see CONNECTIONS.
> The tide pulls. The current flows. Everything is linked by water.

## Beach Verbs: The Brainstorm

### What does the tide do?
- **Ebb** — retreat, pull back (passive)
- **Flow** — move, continuous (good but generic)
- **Pull** — exert force, draw toward (strong but one direction)
- **Reach** — extend, touch distant places (yes!)
- **Surge** — rush forward powerfully (too aggressive for diagrams)

### What do waves do?
- **Crash** — violent impact (too aggressive)
- **Roll** — continuous motion (nice but not connecting)
- **Crest** — the peak moment (momentary, not ongoing)
- **Swell** — build up, gather (internal, not connecting)

### What does the horizon do?
- **Stretch** — extend across distance (static, not active enough)
- **Extend** — same issue
- **Span** — already rejected (too abstract)

### What do YOU do at the beach?
- **Survey** — look across, take in the whole view (clinical)
- **Gaze** — look out at the expanse (passive)
- **Scan** — move your eyes across the vista (active!)
- **Chart** — map the waters (too technical)
- **Navigate** — find your way through (indirect)

### How does water CONNECT?
- **Link** — connect points (too tech, not natural)
- **Thread** — already used for connections themselves
- **Channel** — direct flow between places (interesting!)
- **Current** — the invisible force that connects (noun, not verb)
- **Tide** — the pull that reaches everywhere (noun, but...)

---

## The Breakthrough Moment

Wait.

What if I'm thinking about this wrong?

I keep trying to find what the WATER does.
But the magic of the beach isn't what the water does.
It's what the water REVEALS.

When the tide goes out, you see:
- Tide pools
- Connections between rocks
- Channels carved by water
- The structure that was always there, now visible

The tide **reveals the map**.

---

## The Candidates

### SURGE
**What it means:** A powerful forward rush of water, sudden and forceful
**Why it fits:** Active, powerful, movement with energy
**The vibe:** POWER. Connections that crash through.
**Issues:** Too aggressive for diagrams. Surge feels destructive.

---

### SWELL
**What it means:** The gradual build and rise of water, the gathering before the wave
**Why it fits:** Building, growing, connections forming
**The vibe:** Growth, emergence, gentle power
**Issues:** Too internal. Swell happens WITHIN the ocean, not across it.

---

### REACH
**What it means:** To extend toward, to touch distant places, to connect across distance
**Why it fits:**
- VERB/ACTION ✓
- Connects everything (the tide reaches every shore) ✓
- Power and presence (the reach of the ocean is vast) ✓
- Not delicate (reach has strength) ✓

**The feeling:**
> The tide reaches. The current reaches. Your hand reaches out to touch.
> Reach is the action of CONNECTION across distance.

**Example usage:**
- "Open Reach mode to map your architecture"
- "Reach connects your ideas visually"
- "Let your diagram reach across the page"

**Why it's perfect:**
- **Breeze** = air reaching through your animation
- **Reach** = water reaching across your diagram

**The natural metaphor:**
> The tide reaches every shore. No matter how distant, the water connects them all.
> When you create a diagram, you're mapping those reaches—showing what connects to what,
> how one shore touches another through invisible currents.

**Issues:** None. This feels RIGHT.

---

### CURRENT
**What it means:** The flow of water beneath the surface, invisible but powerful, connecting distant oceans
**Why it fits:** Perfect connection metaphor (ocean currents link every sea)
**The vibe:** Hidden power, invisible structure, connectivity
**Issues:** It's a NOUN. "Open Current mode" feels off. "Current your diagram" doesn't work.

Can we verb it? "Currenting" — no. Awkward.

---

### CHART
**What it means:** To map waters, to draw navigational paths, to document the sea
**Why it fits:** Literally what you do with diagrams (map relationships)
**The vibe:** Nautical, precise, discovery
**Issues:** Too technical. Loses the nature warmth. "Chart" feels like work, not creation.

---

### COURSE
**What it means:** The path a ship takes across water, the route between shores
**Why it fits:** Diagrams ARE courses—paths between nodes
**The vibe:** Direction, journey, navigation
**Issues:** Too indirect. Course is the PATH, not the CONNECTING.

---

### POOL (as in tide pool)
**What it means:** Where water collects when the tide retreats, revealing hidden ecosystems
**Why it fits:** Diagrams reveal structure, show what's hidden
**The vibe:** Discovery, clarity, revealing truth
**Issues:** Too small. Tide pools are intimate, local. We need EXPANSIVE.

---

### CREST
**What it means:** The peak of a wave, the highest point before it breaks
**Why it fits:** The moment of clarity, seeing everything from the top
**The vibe:** Peak moment, visibility, height
**Issues:** Too momentary. Crest is a POINT, not an ongoing state.

---

## The Finalists

### 1. **REACH** 🌊
- Active verb: "reach across the page"
- Connects everything: "the tide reaches every shore"
- Power + presence: "the reach of the ocean"
- Pairs beautifully with Breeze
- Natural, warm, intuitive

### 2. **SWELL** 🌊
- Building energy: "connections swelling into view"
- Gentle power: "the swell before the wave"
- Issues: Too internal, not connective enough

### 3. **CURRENT** 🌊
- Perfect connection metaphor
- Invisible power linking distant places
- Issues: Can't verb it naturally

---

## Testing the Tagline

> "**Reach** is where you map what connects."

> "In **Reach** mode, your diagram spans the shore."

> "The tide reaches every shore. Your ideas reach across the page."

> "**Breeze** sets things in motion. **Reach** shows what they touch."

YES. This works.

## The Decision

# REACH

**It's perfect because:**

1. **VERB energy** — "reach across," "reach out," "reach toward"
2. **Connects EVERYTHING** — the tide reaches all shores, not just two points
3. **Vista energy translated to coast** — seeing the reach of the ocean = seeing the expanse
4. **Power without violence** — reach is strong but not aggressive
5. **Pairs with Breeze** — air and water, motion and connection

**The natural metaphor:**
> The tide reaches every shore it touches. Some reaches are direct—straight across a channel.
> Others are distant—currents connecting oceans half a world apart. When you create a diagram,
> you're mapping those reaches. You're showing what connects to what, which shores touch through
> invisible currents beneath.

**In Grove:**
> Reach is Weave's diagram mode. Place glass cards on the canvas, draw threads between them,
> and watch your architecture emerge. Each thread is a reach—one concept extending toward another,
> connections made visible. The tide reaches. Your diagram reaches. Everything is linked.

---

## The Grove Entry (Draft)

### Reach
**Diagram Mode** · *Sub-mode of Weave*

The tide reaches every shore it touches. Stand at the water's edge and you can see it: the way currents connect distant lands, how one beach flows into the next through invisible channels beneath the surface. The reach of the ocean is vast, touching everything.

Reach is Weave's diagram sub-mode. While Breeze sets animations in motion, Reach maps what connects. Place glass cards on the canvas, connect them with threads, and watch your architecture emerge. System diagrams, flowcharts, mind maps—anything where you need to show relationships. Each thread is a reach: one concept extending toward another, connections made visible.

*The tide reaches. Your diagram reaches. Everything is linked.*

---

## Why This Works

**Breeze** (animation):
- Air / wind
- Motion propagating through chains
- Things that MOVE
- "Send a breeze through your scene"

**Reach** (diagrams):
- Water / tide
- Connections spanning distance
- Things that CONNECT
- "Map what your system reaches"

Together they form the complete picture:
- **Breeze** = dynamic motion
- **Reach** = static connection

Both are nature verbs. Both are active. Both feel alive.

---

## The Feeling Test

Close your eyes. You're standing on the shore.

The breeze moves through the air—you feel it on your skin, watch it ripple through leaves.

The tide reaches out before you—extending toward distant shores, connecting everything through water.

You open Weave.

**Breeze mode:** Set your scene in motion. Watch chains of movement flow.

**Reach mode:** Map what connects. Draw the threads that span distance.

YES.

*This is it. This is the one.*
