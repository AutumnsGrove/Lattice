# Diagram Mode Naming Journey 4: The Action Word

Date: 2026-01-07
Context: Naming the diagram sub-mode within Weave (animation = Breeze)

---

## What Didn't Land (And Why)

Previous attempts:
- **Trace** — too passive, generic
- **Dew** — passive, delicate
- **Frost** — not action-like
- **Ridge** — TOO MUCH OF A PLACE. A noun, a location. Not what we're doing.

## The Key Insight

The user wants:
1. An **ACTION word** - a **VERB**
2. The feeling of CONNECTING with power
3. That mountaintop/jungle vista energy
4. Something you **DO**, not somewhere you **ARE**

**Breeze** works because even though it's technically a noun, it feels active. A breeze MOVES THROUGH the space. It's not static.

The diagram mode needs that same energy - a word that IS an action or feels like one.

## What IS Diagramming?

Let me think about what happens when you diagram with power...

You're standing on a mountaintop, looking out at the jungle below. You can SEE EVERYTHING. And what do you do with that clarity? You DRAW THE LINES. You MAP THE CONNECTIONS. You CHART THE TERRITORY.

It's not passive observation. It's active connection-making.

```
               ☀️  mountaintop clarity
           🏔️
          /  \
         /    \
        /      \
    🌴🌴      🌴🌴
     |         |
     |    SPAN |
     |         |
    🌴🌴      🌴🌴

You're not just looking.
You're SPANNING the gap.
You're BRIDGING the distance.
You're REACHING across to connect.
```

## Visualizing the Grove

```
                              ☀️
                           🌲   🌲   🌲
                        🌲    🌳    🌲
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
        Weave (the visual composition studio)

        Sub-modes:
        → Breeze (animation - it moves through)
        → ??? (diagram - it connects across)
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
               ROOTS CONNECT BENEATH
                  (mycelium network)
```

Weave is where you compose. Breeze is how things move. The diagram mode is how you CONNECT.

## Walking Through the Forest: The Action Verbs

What are the ACTIONS of powerful diagramming?

### Bridge Verbs
- **Spanning** (like a bridge spans a gap)
- **Bridging** (connecting across)
- **Linking** (connecting distant points)

### Navigation Verbs
- **Charting** (plotting the course)
- **Mapping** (charting territory)
- **Surveying** (taking in the whole view)

### Extension Verbs
- **Reaching** (extending to connect)
- **Ranging** (seeing far, covering ground)

### Nature Verbs with Connecting Energy
What do natural things DO that connects?
- Vines **REACH**, **CLIMB**, **GRASP**
- Roots **SPREAD**, **CONNECT**
- Birds from high places **SURVEY**, **RANGE**
- Bridges **SPAN**
- Rivers **BRANCH**

## The Feeling: Standing on the Mountain

I'm standing on a mountain peak, looking out at the jungle below. I can see EVERYTHING—distant clearings, hidden paths, how it all connects. And I'm not just looking. I'm DRAWING THE LINES. I'm making the invisible connections visible.

What's that action?

It's **SPANNING** the distance. It's **BRIDGING** the gaps. It's **REACHING** across the vista to say "THIS connects to THAT."

---

## Testing Candidates

Let me feel each one:

### **Span**
> "I'm spanning the components."
> "Use Span to connect these nodes."

A span is:
- A bridge spans a gap
- The span of your arms reaching out
- A span of time (but we want spatial)
- A wingspan (spreading wide to cover distance)

Span feels like: REACHING ACROSS. COVERING THE DISTANCE. CONNECTING TWO DISTANT POINTS.

Is it a verb? YES. "To span" is definitely a verb.
Does it feel active? YES. When you span something, you're actively connecting.
Does it have that mountaintop energy? YES. You're spanning across the vista.

**Potential issues:**
- HTML `<span>` tag? But that's a totally different context. Not a real conflict.
- Timespan? Again, different context.

### **Bridge**
> "I'm bridging these components."
> "Use Bridge to connect these nodes."

A bridge is:
- A structure that connects
- "Bridging the gap" (the metaphor is perfect!)
- But it's ALSO a noun (the bridge itself)

Bridge feels like: CONNECTING TWO SIDES. TRAVERSING THE GAP.

Is it a verb? YES. "To bridge" is a verb.
Does it feel active? YES, but also a bit... structural? Like you're building infrastructure?
Does it have that mountaintop energy? Sort of, but more horizontal than expansive.

### **Reach**
> "I'm reaching between these components."
> "Use Reach to connect these nodes."

Reach is:
- Extending to touch something distant
- Your reach (the span of your influence)
- Reaching out (connecting socially)

Reach feels like: EXTENDING TO TOUCH. GRASPING FOR CONNECTION.

Is it a verb? YES. "To reach" is absolutely a verb.
Does it feel active? VERY. Reaching is dynamic, intentional.
Does it have that mountaintop energy? Hmm, it's more personal/intimate than expansive?

### **Range**
> "I'm ranging across the diagram."
> "Use Range to map these connections."

Range is:
- The distance you can cover
- Roaming freely (ranging across the territory)
- Birds ranging over the landscape from a high perch
- A mountain range (but that's a noun)

Range feels like: MOVING FREELY ACROSS WIDE TERRITORY. SURVEYING FROM ABOVE.

Is it a verb? YES. "To range" is a verb (less common, but real).
Does it feel active? Yes, but maybe too... wandering? Not as direct as connecting?
Does it have that mountaintop energy? YES - ranging across the vista!

### **Chart**
> "I'm charting these connections."
> "Use Chart to diagram the flow."

Chart is:
- Mapping out the course
- Plotting on a chart
- A chart (but also the verb "to chart")

Chart feels like: PLOTTING THE COURSE. MAKING THE MAP.

Is it a verb? YES.
Does it feel active? YES.
Does it have that mountaintop energy? Hmm, it's more about the artifact (the chart) than the action?

## The Finalists

Narrowing down to the ones that truly feel like VERBS with POWER:

1. **Span** — Reaching across the distance, covering the gap, connecting distant points
2. **Reach** — Extending to touch, grasping for connection
3. **Range** — Moving freely across wide territory, surveying from above

But **Span** feels the most right. Here's why:

### Why SPAN Works

**In nature:**
- A bridge spans a chasm
- Wings span wide to catch the wind
- Arms span to embrace what's distant
- A vista spans before you

**In Weave:**
- You're spanning components across the canvas
- You're spanning the distance between nodes
- You're creating spans of connection

**The feeling:**
- Standing on that mountain
- Seeing the jungle spread out below
- And SPANNING across it with your understanding
- Drawing lines that span from here to there
- Connecting what seemed distant

**It's a VERB:**
- "Span these nodes together"
- "I'm spanning the architecture"
- "Use Span to connect across the diagram"

**Pairing with Breeze:**
- **Breeze** — the movement THROUGH the space (wind flowing)
- **Span** — the connection ACROSS the space (bridge reaching)

One flows. One spans. Both are active, both are nature-adjacent, both are verbs that feel like forces.

## Testing the Tagline

> "Span is where you connect across the distance."

Or better:

> "Span is how you draw the lines that connect everything."

Even better:

> "Chart the connections. Span the distance."

---

## The Decision

**SPAN**

It's a verb. It's active. It's got that mountaintop-to-jungle-vista energy. It's the ACTION of connecting across distance with power and clarity.

When you're in Span mode, you're not just placing boxes. You're SPANNING the architecture. You're reaching across the canvas, connecting distant components, making the invisible structure visible.

## The Full Entry

### Span
**Chart the connections** · Weave sub-mode (diagrams)

A span is the distance between two points, bridged and connected. A bridge spans a chasm. Wings span wide to catch the wind. Your arms span to embrace what's distant. From the mountaintop, the vista spans before you: and you draw the lines that connect it all.

Span is Weave's diagram mode. Where Breeze animates motion through space, Span maps the architecture across it. Chart component relationships. Draw data flows. Connect nodes with intention. Every line you draw spans the distance, making structure visible.

*Reach across. Connect what's distant. Span the space between.*

## Why This Lands

1. **It's a VERB** — "to span" is an action
2. **It feels active** — spanning is dynamic, intentional, powerful
3. **It has mountaintop energy** — you span across the vista, seeing and connecting everything
4. **It pairs with Breeze** — Breeze flows through, Span reaches across
5. **It's nature-adjacent** — wings span, bridges span, vistas span
6. **It's about CONNECTION** — the core of what diagramming IS

Ridge didn't work because it was a place. Span works because it's what you DO in that place.

You stand on the ridge. And from there, you SPAN the territory.
