# Naming Journey: The Freelance Workbench

## What We're Naming

A standalone repo that holds Autumn's entire freelance practice:

- The Raven (security audit skill)
- The Osprey (project estimation skill)
- Documents (services agreement, proposal template, scope cheat sheet, runbook)
- The complete client engagement pipeline
- Future: client records, quote archives, before/after reports

This is the Wayfinder's personal toolkit for work she does OUTSIDE
the grove — freelance security consulting for other people's codebases.

                      ↓
              Goes OUT to client
              codebases, comes
              back with findings
```

This thing sits at the EDGE of the grove. It faces outward.
It's where the Wayfinder keeps her tools for venturing into
other people's forests.

## What IS This Thing?

**Fundamentally:** A workspace. A preparation space. Home base.

**What it does in the user's life:**

- Stores tools (Raven, Osprey skills)
- Stores documents (agreement, proposal, cheat sheet, runbook)
- Houses the pipeline (inquiry → audit → quote → deliver)
- Is where you return between client engagements

**What emotion should it evoke:**

- Preparedness ("I'm ready for this")
- Professional confidence ("I have a system")
- Warmth ("this is MY space, my home base")
- Competence ("everything I need is right here")

**Key characteristic:**
The Raven and Osprey are BIRDS. Birds of prey. They hunt,
they return. They need a home base. This is it.

---

## Direction Change: Da Vinci's Workshop

Roost didn't land. Birds are the wrong metaphor for the
CONTAINER. The animals are what's inside — the Raven, the
Osprey — but the space itself should evoke something different.

New direction: **the machinery of Da Vinci's workshop.**
Medieval. Gears and parchment. Candlelight on brass instruments.
The inventor's table where mechanisms are designed, where
blueprints become reality.

Not a nest. A **workshop**. A place of craft and invention.

                  Stone walls. Oak beams.
                  Candlelight on brass.

## Walking Through... (Take Two)

I enter the grove. I walk past the Meadow, past the trees,
past everything familiar.

At the edge of the forest, where the old oaks lean apart,
there's a stone building half-hidden by ivy. Older than the
grove itself. A heavy oak door, iron-banded, slightly ajar.

I push it open. Candlelight. The smell of parchment and
linseed oil. A long workbench runs the length of the room,
covered in documents — agreements, proposals, case files.
Brass instruments gleam in the light: calipers for measuring
scope, scales for weighing estimates.

On the wall, a mechanism — gears interlocking. The pipeline.
Each gear turns the next: Inquiry drives Assessment, which
drives the Audit, which drives the Quote. Clockwork.

In the corner, leather-bound volumes. The Codex of past
engagements. The Grimoire of skills. The Ledger of hours.

This isn't a nest. It's a WORKSHOP. A place where the
Wayfinder crafts the instruments of her trade. Medieval in
its bones. Da Vinci in its ambition. Every tool designed
with precision, every document written with care.

The animals come and go — the Raven with its case files,
the Osprey with its estimates — but the WORKSHOP endures.
It was here before them. It will outlast any single engagement.

What is this place called?

## Candidates

### 1. Codex

**The master's collected knowledge, bound and organized.**

- In history: Da Vinci's Codex Atlanticus, Codex Leicester,
  Codex Arundel — his most famous legacy. Each one a bound
  collection of notes, sketches, plans, and inventions. The
  organized knowledge of the master.
- **The etymology:** Latin _cōdex_ literally means "tree trunk"
  or "block of wood." Wood → writing tablet → bound book →
  collected knowledge. The word itself bridges TREE and
  MANUSCRIPT. It was born in the grove.
- Why it fits: Your freelance toolkit IS a codex — a bound
  collection of professional knowledge. The runbook, the
  agreement, the cheat sheet, the proposal template. Every
  skill, every document, every pipeline step. Organized.
  Precious. Referenced constantly.
- The vibe: Scholarly, warm, weighty. Something you'd find
  on a shelf in a candlelit workshop, spine cracked from use.
- Tagline test: "Codex — the collected works."
- `AutumnsGrove/Codex` — clean, strong.
- Potential issues: Common in gaming/tech. But in Grove's
  ecosystem, where every name has a nature etymology, the
  tree-trunk origin recontextualizes it completely.

### 2. Bottega

**The Italian Renaissance workshop.**

- In history: A _bottega_ was the workshop of a master artist
  in Renaissance Italy. Da Vinci trained in Verrocchio's bottega
  in Florence. Apprentices learned, tools were shared, and
  masterworks were born from a single room. The word itself
  means "shop" or "workshop" — the place where the craft lives.
- Why it fits: This IS a workshop. Not a library, not a vault —
  a working space where things are made. Proposals are drafted.
  Estimates are calculated. Skills are honed. The bottega is
  alive with work.
- The vibe: Warm, Italian, artisanal. Sawdust and linseed oil.
  The master at her bench. Inviting without being precious.
- Tagline test: "Bottega — where the craft lives."
- `AutumnsGrove/Bottega` — distinctive, memorable.
- Potential issues: Italian word — might need pronunciation
  help (boh-TAY-gah). Also: Bottega Veneta (fashion brand)
  might create associations. But the Renaissance meaning is
  stronger and older.

### 3. Forge

**Where raw material becomes something useful.**

- In history: The blacksmith's forge — fire, anvil, hammer.
  Where ore becomes blade. Where raw findings become polished
  proposals. Medieval, universal, elemental.
- Why it fits: The Raven brings raw findings. The Osprey forges
  them into proposals. The documents are forged — shaped by
  heat and precision into something clients can hold. The forge
  is transformation.
- The vibe: Strong, elemental, warm (literally — fire). Simple.
  One syllable.
- Tagline test: "Forge — shape the work."
- `AutumnsGrove/Forge` — clean, punchy.
- Potential issues: VERY common in tech (GitHub had Forge,
  Atlassian has Forge, SourceForge...). Might feel generic.
  Also leans aggressive — hammers and fire might clash with
  Grove's gentle nature aesthetic.

### 4. Grimoire

**A book of invocations.**

- In history: A grimoire is a medieval textbook of magic —
  instructions for invoking spirits, crafting talismans, and
  performing rituals. Each entry is a detailed procedure.
  Follow the steps exactly. The invocation works.
- Why it fits: Your skills ARE invocations. `/raven-investigate`
  — invoke the Raven. `/osprey-appraise` — invoke the Osprey.
  The runbook is literally a step-by-step ritual. The cheat
  sheet is a protection spell. The proposal template is a
  summoning circle for client trust. You open the grimoire,
  follow the procedure, and the magic happens.
- The vibe: Mysterious, powerful, a little witchy. Candlelight
  on old pages. Handwritten marginalia. Dog-eared from use.
- Tagline test: "Grimoire — invoke the craft."
- `AutumnsGrove/Grimoire` — atmospheric, memorable.
- Potential issues: "Magic" framing might undercut the
  professionalism. Also slightly dark/occult — though Grove
  already has Thorn, Shade, and animal invocations, so the
  ecosystem can hold it. Three syllables (GRIM-wahr).

### 5. Almanac

**The practitioner's reference for all seasons.**

- In history: Medieval almanacs were indispensable reference
  books — astronomical tables, planting calendars, weather
  predictions, medical advice. Farmers, sailors, and merchants
  carried them everywhere. A practical compendium for
  navigating the year's work.
- Why it fits: Your toolkit IS an almanac — a reference for
  every season of client work. When to quote (the Osprey
  tables). When to audit (the Raven procedures). What to
  charge (the pricing tables). How to handle scope creep
  (the defense scripts). Consult the almanac before every
  engagement. It has the answer.
- The vibe: Practical, worn, beloved. Tucked into a coat
  pocket. Referenced so often the spine is soft. Annotated
  in the margins with personal notes.
- Tagline test: "Almanac — for every season of work."
- `AutumnsGrove/Almanac` — warm, familiar.
- Potential issues: Might feel too "book" and not enough
  "workshop." An almanac is something you READ. A workshop
  is something you WORK IN. But the freelance toolkit is
  honestly more reference-book than workshop — you consult
  it, follow its procedures, use its templates.

## The Walk Continues...

I'm standing in the workshop. Candlelight flickers on the
walls. The gears of the pipeline mechanism turn slowly.

On the workbench: a leather-bound volume. Heavy. The cover
is embossed. Inside: sketches and procedures. The Raven's
investigation protocol. The Osprey's estimation tables.
The scope cheat sheet. The client agreement. Everything
the Wayfinder needs, bound together.

I pick it up. It's warm in my hands. Well-used. Annotated.
Some pages are worn thin from reference. The pricing tables
have pencil marks in the margins — adjustments from past
engagements. The red flags section has new entries added in
different inks, from different seasons.

This isn't just a toolkit. It's a living document. A
practitioner's manual that grows with experience. Every
engagement teaches something new, and the new knowledge
gets added.

What do you call a bound collection of a master's knowledge,
grown over years of practice, rooted in the oldest wood?

---

## The Decision

**Codex** stands above the rest.

Here's why:

**The etymology is too perfect to ignore.** Latin _cōdex_
means "tree trunk." The word itself grew from wood. It was
born in the grove — literally. A codex is what happens when
a tree becomes knowledge. Bark becomes page. Wood becomes
wisdom. The most Grove word imaginable, and it predates
Grove by two thousand years.

**The Da Vinci connection is direct.** When people hear
"Codex," many think of Da Vinci's notebooks. The Codex
Atlanticus. The Codex Leicester. Bound collections of an
inventor's sketches, calculations, and procedures. That's
EXACTLY what this repo is — your sketches (skills), your
calculations (Osprey), your procedures (runbook).

**It captures what the repo actually IS.** Not a workshop
(you don't build things here — you build in CLIENT repos).
Not a forge (nothing is smelted). It's a reference. A bound
collection. A codex you consult before every engagement and
annotate after every one.

**It sounds right.**

- "Check the Codex." ✓
- "I added a new template to the Codex." ✓
- "The Codex has the pricing tables." ✓
- "Open the Codex and run the Raven protocol." ✓

## The Name: Codex

**The collected works.** · `AutumnsGrove/Codex`

In Latin, _cōdex_ means "tree trunk" — the block of wood
from which writing tablets were carved. Wood became page.
Page became book. Book became the master's collected knowledge.
Two thousand years later, the word still means what it always
meant: everything the practitioner knows, bound and organized.

Da Vinci kept codices. His sketches, calculations, procedures,
inventions — all bound together, annotated in the margins,
referenced constantly. The Codex Atlanticus alone spans forty
years of work. Every engagement taught him something new. The
new knowledge went into the codex.

Codex is the Wayfinder's bound collection of freelance
knowledge. The Raven's investigation protocols. The Osprey's
estimation tables. The services agreement. The proposal
template. The scope cheat sheet. The engagement runbook.
Client archives. Quote history. Everything needed to run a
security consulting practice, organized and precious.

You don't work IN the codex. You consult it before every
engagement and annotate it after every one. It grows with
experience. Some pages are worn thin from reference. The
pricing tables have pencil marks in the margins. The red
flags section gains new entries in different inks, from
different seasons.

It was born from a tree. It lives in the grove.

_Open the Codex. The knowledge is there._

## Runners Up

| Name         | Why It Almost Worked                   | Why Codex Wins                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Bottega**  | Warm, Italian, "where the craft lives" | This is more reference than workshop    |
| **Grimoire** | Skills as invocations — very fun       | Too dark/occult for the tone            |
| **Almanac**  | Practical reference, seasonal, beloved | Codex has the tree etymology + Da Vinci |
| **Forge**    | Transformation, fire, medieval         | Too common in tech, too aggressive      |

## Conflict Check

- "Codex" does not appear as an existing Grove service name
- Does not conflict with any existing concept
- Two syllables (COH-dex), clean pronunciation
- `AutumnsGrove/Codex` — strong, distinctive repo name
- The Latin "tree trunk" etymology places it firmly in the grove
- Da Vinci's codices give it the medieval workshop energy
- Common enough to be recognizable, specific enough to be meaningful
