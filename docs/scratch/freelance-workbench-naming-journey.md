# Naming Journey: The Freelance Workbench

## What We're Naming

A standalone repo that holds Autumn's entire freelance practice:

- The Raven (security audit skill)
- The Osprey (project estimation skill)
- Documents (services agreement, proposal template, scope cheat sheet, runbook)
- The complete client engagement pipeline
- Future: client records, quote archives, before/after reports

This is the Wayfinder's personal toolkit for work she does OUTSIDE
the grove — freelance security consulting for other people's codebases.

This thing sits at the EDGE of the grove. It faces outward.
It's where the Wayfinder keeps her tools for venturing into
other people's forests.

## What IS This Thing?

**Fundamentally:** A workspace. A preparation space. Home base.

**What it does in the user's life:**

- Stores tools (Raven, Osprey skills)
- Stores documents (agreement, proposal, cheat sheet, runbook)
- Houses the pipeline (inquiry → audit → quote → deliver)
- Is where you return between client engagements

**What emotion should it evoke:**

- Preparedness ("I'm ready for this")
- Professional confidence ("I have a system")
- Warmth ("this is MY space, my home base")
- Competence ("everything I need is right here")

**Key characteristic:**
The Raven and Osprey are BIRDS. Birds of prey. They hunt,
they return. They need a home base. This is it.

---

## Direction Change: Da Vinci's Workshop

Roost didn't land. Birds are the wrong metaphor for the
CONTAINER. The animals are what's inside — the Raven, the
Osprey — but the space itself should evoke something different.

New direction: **the machinery of Da Vinci's workshop.**
Medieval. Gears and parchment. Candlelight on brass instruments.
The inventor's table where mechanisms are designed, where
blueprints become reality.

Not a nest. A **workshop**. A place of craft and invention.

## Walking Through... (Take Two)

I enter the grove. I walk past the Meadow, past the trees,
past everything familiar.

At the edge of the forest, where the old oaks lean apart,
there's a stone building half-hidden by ivy. Older than the
grove itself. A heavy oak door, iron-banded, slightly ajar.

I push it open. Candlelight. The smell of parchment and
linseed oil. A long workbench runs the length of the room,
covered in documents — agreements, proposals, case files.
Brass instruments gleam in the light: calipers for measuring
scope, scales for weighing estimates.

On the wall, a mechanism — gears interlocking. The pipeline.
Each gear turns the next: Inquiry drives Assessment, which
drives the Audit, which drives the Quote. Clockwork.

In the corner, leather-bound volumes. The Codex of past
engagements. The Grimoire of skills. The Ledger of hours.

This isn't a nest. It's a WORKSHOP. A place where the
Wayfinder crafts the instruments of her trade. Medieval in
its bones. Da Vinci in its ambition. Every tool designed
with precision, every document written with care.

The animals come and go — the Raven with its case files,
the Osprey with its estimates — but the WORKSHOP endures.
It was here before them. It will outlast any single engagement.

What is this place called?

---

## Candidates

### 1. Codex

**The master's collected knowledge, bound and organized.**

- In history: Da Vinci's Codex Atlanticus, Codex Leicester,
  Codex Arundel — his most famous legacy. Each one a bound
  collection of notes, sketches, plans, and inventions. The
  organized knowledge of the master.
- **The etymology:** Latin _cōdex_ literally means "tree trunk"
  or "block of wood." Wood → writing tablet → bound book →
  collected knowledge. The word itself bridges TREE and
  MANUSCRIPT. It was born in the grove.
- Why it fits: Your freelance toolkit IS a codex — a bound
  collection of professional knowledge. The runbook, the
  agreement, the cheat sheet, the proposal template. Every
  skill, every document, every pipeline step. Organized.
  Precious. Referenced constantly.
- The vibe: Scholarly, warm, weighty. Something you'd find
  on a shelf in a candlelit workshop, spine cracked from use.
- Tagline test: "Codex — the collected works."
- `AutumnsGrove/Codex` — clean, strong.
- Potential issues: Common in gaming/tech. But in Grove's
  ecosystem, where every name has a nature etymology, the
  tree-trunk origin recontextualizes it completely.

### 2. Bottega

**The Italian Renaissance workshop.**

- In history: A _bottega_ was the workshop of a master artist
  in Renaissance Italy. Da Vinci trained in Verrocchio's bottega
  in Florence. Apprentices learned, tools were shared, and
  masterworks were born from a single room. The word itself
  means "shop" or "workshop" — the place where the craft lives.
- Why it fits: This IS a workshop. Not a library, not a vault —
  a working space where things are made. Proposals are drafted.
  Estimates are calculated. Skills are honed. The bottega is
  alive with work.
- The vibe: Warm, Italian, artisanal. Sawdust and linseed oil.
  The master at her bench. Inviting without being precious.
- Tagline test: "Bottega — where the craft lives."
- `AutumnsGrove/Bottega` — distinctive, memorable.
- Potential issues: Italian word — might need pronunciation
  help (boh-TAY-gah). Also: Bottega Veneta (fashion brand)
  might create associations. But the Renaissance meaning is
  stronger and older.

### 3. Forge

**Where raw material becomes something useful.**

- In history: The blacksmith's forge — fire, anvil, hammer.
  Where ore becomes blade. Where raw findings become polished
  proposals. Medieval, universal, elemental.
- Why it fits: The Raven brings raw findings. The Osprey forges
  them into proposals. The documents are forged — shaped by
  heat and precision into something clients can hold. The forge
  is transformation.
- The vibe: Strong, elemental, warm (literally — fire). Simple.
  One syllable.
- Tagline test: "Forge — shape the work."
- `AutumnsGrove/Forge` — clean, punchy.
- Potential issues: VERY common in tech (GitHub had Forge,
  Atlassian has Forge, SourceForge...). Might feel generic.
  Also leans aggressive — hammers and fire might clash with
  Grove's gentle nature aesthetic.

### 4. Grimoire

**A book of invocations.**

- In history: A grimoire is a medieval textbook of magic —
  instructions for invoking spirits, crafting talismans, and
  performing rituals. Each entry is a detailed procedure.
  Follow the steps exactly. The invocation works.
- Why it fits: Your skills ARE invocations. `/raven-investigate`
  — invoke the Raven. `/osprey-appraise` — invoke the Osprey.
  The runbook is literally a step-by-step ritual. The cheat
  sheet is a protection spell. The proposal template is a
  summoning circle for client trust. You open the grimoire,
  follow the procedure, and the magic happens.
- The vibe: Mysterious, powerful, a little witchy. Candlelight
  on old pages. Handwritten marginalia. Dog-eared from use.
- Tagline test: "Grimoire — invoke the craft."
- `AutumnsGrove/Grimoire` — atmospheric, memorable.
- Potential issues: "Magic" framing might undercut the
  professionalism. Also slightly dark/occult — though Grove
  already has Thorn, Shade, and animal invocations, so the
  ecosystem can hold it. Three syllables (GRIM-wahr).

### 5. Almanac

**The practitioner's reference for all seasons.**

- In history: Medieval almanacs were indispensable reference
  books — astronomical tables, planting calendars, weather
  predictions, medical advice. Farmers, sailors, and merchants
  carried them everywhere. A practical compendium for
  navigating the year's work.
- Why it fits: Your toolkit IS an almanac — a reference for
  every season of client work. When to quote (the Osprey
  tables). When to audit (the Raven procedures). What to
  charge (the pricing tables). How to handle scope creep
  (the defense scripts). Consult the almanac before every
  engagement. It has the answer.
- The vibe: Practical, worn, beloved. Tucked into a coat
  pocket. Referenced so often the spine is soft. Annotated
  in the margins with personal notes.
- Tagline test: "Almanac — for every season of work."
- `AutumnsGrove/Almanac` — warm, familiar.
- Potential issues: Might feel too "book" and not enough
  "workshop." An almanac is something you READ. A workshop
  is something you WORK IN. But the freelance toolkit is
  honestly more reference-book than workshop — you consult
  it, follow its procedures, use its templates.

## The Walk Continues...

I'm standing in the workshop. Candlelight flickers on the
walls. The gears of the pipeline mechanism turn slowly.

On the workbench: a leather-bound volume. Heavy. The cover
is embossed. Inside: sketches and procedures. The Raven's
investigation protocol. The Osprey's estimation tables.
The scope cheat sheet. The client agreement. Everything
the Wayfinder needs, bound together.

I pick it up. It's warm in my hands. Well-used. Annotated.
Some pages are worn thin from reference. The pricing tables
have pencil marks in the margins — adjustments from past
engagements. The red flags section has new entries added in
different inks, from different seasons.

This isn't just a toolkit. It's a living document. A
practitioner's manual that grows with experience. Every
engagement teaches something new, and the new knowledge
gets added.

What do you call a bound collection of a master's knowledge,
grown over years of practice, rooted in the oldest wood?

---

## Codex: Back Pocket

Codex is a beautiful word. The tree-trunk etymology is
perfect. But OpenAI speared it — "Codex" now means "AI
coding platform" in most developers' minds. Standing in
the middle of that fight isn't worth it. The word is
preserved but not chosen.

---

## Speaking with Da Vinci

I need to stop naming from a DISTANCE and get INTO the
workshop. What was it actually LIKE?

Leonardo's workshop in Milan. The Corte Vecchia, 1490s.

Picture the room. It's not organized. It's a majestic
mess. On the workbench: a half-dissected bird wing pinned
open next to a sketch of a flying machine. Mathematical
tables stacked on top of anatomical drawings. A human skull
sits next to a glass of wine. Mirrors everywhere — he
writes backwards, left-handed, everything mirrored so no
one can read his notes over his shoulder.

In one corner: a wooden model of a gear mechanism, half
assembled. The gears don't mesh yet. He's working out a
problem in three dimensions.

On the wall: a preparatory cartoon for a painting that
was commissioned two years ago and still isn't finished.
The client has written three letters. Leonardo hasn't
responded to any of them. (He will, eventually. The work
will be transcendent. But not today.)

Scattered across every surface: NOTEBOOKS. Not organized
by topic. A single page might contain:

- A study of water flowing around a stone
- A note about purchasing linseed oil
- A sketch of a siege weapon
- A diagram of the muscles of the human arm
- A reminder that "the sun does not move"

The notebooks are the thing. Not the workshop. Not the
tools. THE NOTEBOOKS. They're where Leonardo THINKS.
Where observations become connections. Where a bird's
wing becomes a flying machine. Where a river's current
becomes a hydraulic pump.

But we can't use "codex."

So what ELSE was in that workshop?

## BESTIARY.

A bestiary is a medieval illustrated compendium of beasts.

Each page: a creature. Drawn in detail. Its nature
described. Its habits cataloged. Its meaning explained.
Real animals alongside mythical ones — the lion and the
unicorn shared the same pages. What mattered wasn't
whether the creature was "real." What mattered was what
it MEANT. What it could DO. How to work with it.

Bestiaries were among the most popular books in medieval
Europe. Second only to the Bible. Monks illustrated them
with gold leaf. Scholars annotated them in the margins.
Travelers carried them. Every educated person owned one.

Da Vinci drew animals obsessively. Horses, birds, cats,
dragons. He studied their anatomy, their movement, their
mechanics. He understood: to build a flying machine, you
must first understand the beast that flies.

Now look at what's in this repo:

     Illustrated. Annotated.
     Every beast, cataloged.
```

It's not a codex of knowledge. It's not a workshop of
tools. It's a BESTIARY. A catalog of creatures — each
one illustrated, each one described, each one invoked
for a specific purpose.

The skills ARE the beasts. The Raven. The Osprey. The
Raccoon. The Turtle. The Spider. The Beaver. Each one
has a nature. Each one has habits. Each one has a page
in the book.

And the documents? They're the MARGINALIA. The
practitioner's annotations. The notes scrawled between
the beast entries: "When facing a Django app, invoke
the Raven first, then the Osprey. Budget 15% extra.
Here is the agreement template. Here is the cheat
sheet for red flags."

**This is the only name that bridges BOTH naming worlds
in the Grove ecosystem:** the animal skills AND the
medieval workshop. A bestiary is LITERALLY a medieval
book of animals. It's the intersection of everything.

## Testing "Bestiary"

**Sentence tests:**

- "Open the Bestiary." ✓ Evocative. Immediate.
- "Check the Bestiary for the Raven protocol." ✓
- "I added a new beast to the Bestiary." ✓ LOVE this.
- "The Bestiary has the engagement runbook." ✓
- "Consult the Bestiary before the client call." ✓

**Tagline tests:**

- "A book of beasts." — Clean. Perfect. Done.
- "Every creature, cataloged." — Precise.
- "Know your beasts." — Punchy.
- "The creatures within." — Mysterious.

**Repo name:** `AutumnsGrove/Bestiary` — distinctive,
memorable, immediately evocative.

**The vibe:** You pull a heavy, leather-bound book from
the shelf. The cover is embossed with animal figures.
Inside, each page is an illustration: the Raven with
its magnifying glass, the Osprey hovering over a river
of numbers, the Turtle carrying its shell of defenses.
Between the beast entries, handwritten notes in the
margins — pricing tables, red flag lists, client
scripts. Dog-eared pages where you always turn first.
Gold leaf on the section dividers.

Medieval. Da Vinci. Animals. Documents. One word.

## The Name: Bestiary

**A book of beasts.** · `AutumnsGrove/Bestiary`

In medieval Europe, a bestiary was an illustrated
compendium of creatures — each one drawn in careful
detail, its nature described, its purpose explained.
Real animals alongside mythical ones. Lions and unicorns
shared the same gilt-edged pages. What mattered wasn't
taxonomy. What mattered was: what does this creature DO?
How does it behave? When do you call upon it?

Da Vinci filled his notebooks with animal studies.
Horses in motion. Birds in flight. Cats in repose.
He understood that to build a flying machine, you must
first study the beast that flies. The observation
precedes the invention. The bestiary precedes the work.

The Bestiary is the Wayfinder's illustrated catalog of
freelance creatures. Each beast has a page: its nature,
its habits, its invocation. The Raven investigates. The
Osprey appraises. The Raccoon audits. The Turtle hardens.
The Spider weaves. The Beaver builds. Between the beast
entries: the practitioner's marginalia. Pricing tables.
Red flag lists. Client scripts. The services agreement.
The engagement runbook. Everything annotated in different
inks from different seasons.

You don't just READ the Bestiary. You INVOKE it. Open
the page. Speak the name. The beast appears and does
its work. When the work is done, the beast returns to
its page. You annotate what you learned. The Bestiary
grows.

_A book of beasts._

## Conflict Check

- "Bestiary" does not appear as an existing Grove service name
- Does not conflict with any existing concept
- Four syllables (BEST-ee-air-ee) — same length as Terrarium
- `AutumnsGrove/Bestiary` — strong, distinctive repo name
- Bridges the animal skill names with medieval workshop energy
- No tech company has claimed this word
- Immediately evocative — everyone knows what a bestiary is
- The "best" in "bestiary" is a nice accident

## Correction: Bestiary Is a Book, Not a Room

Autumn's feedback: "I don't think it's a PLACE though.
We are describing my workshop. Not the contents. Yes, we
will have a bestiary within the workshop. But that's not
what it's called."

She's right. The Bestiary is a book on the shelf. Not the
shelf. Not the room. Not the workshop. The Raven lives in
the Bestiary as an entry. But the Bestiary itself lives
INSIDE the workshop. We need the ROOM.

So Bestiary becomes the name for the internal catalog of
animal skills — a perfect sub-concept. But the repo name
is the SPACE that contains it.

Back to the spaces. What is this room?

---

## Back to the Room

What we know about this room:

1. It's at the EDGE of the grove, facing outward
2. The Wayfinder goes OUT from here to client codebases
3. She comes BACK here with findings
4. It contains:
   - The Bestiary (animal skill catalog)
   - Documents (agreement, proposal, cheat sheet, runbook)
   - Archives (client records, quote history)
   - Tools (calipers, instruments, precision equipment)
5. It's where preparation happens BEFORE an engagement
6. It's where processing happens AFTER an engagement
7. It's HER space. Private. Personal. Professional.

The feeling: You open the door. The room smells like
old paper and linseed oil. Light comes through one tall
window. A heavy wooden table dominates the center —
scarred with use, stained with ink. On the table: an
open book (the Bestiary), a brass compass, a half-drafted
proposal. Shelves line the walls — scrolls, ledgers,
specimen jars, labeled drawers. A cloak hangs by the
door. Boots underneath. This is where you gear up before
going into the forest. This is where you debrief when
you come back.

Now. What do you CALL that room?

## Renaissance Spaces (Serious Pass)

**Bottega** — The master craftsperson's workshop. Where
apprentices learn, where commissions are fulfilled, where
the work happens. Da Vinci's bottega was legendary. The
word is warm, Italian, three syllables (bot-TAY-ga).

But: a bottega implies multiple people. A master and
apprentices. Autumn works alone. Also, a bottega is where
you BUILD things for clients who come to you. Autumn goes
TO clients. The direction is reversed.

**Studiolo** — A small private study room in an Italian
Renaissance palace. The studiolo was personal, intimate,
intellectual. Often decorated with trompe l'oeil paintings
of books and instruments. It was where the duke or scholar
retreated to THINK. To study. To prepare.

Federico da Montefeltro's studiolo in Urbino is the most
famous: walls covered in intricate wood inlay (intarsia)
depicting books, musical instruments, armor, scientific
tools — all rendered in perspective so they look real.
A room designed to look like it's full of the tools of
knowledge, even when they're illusions. The real tools
were there too. But the room ITSELF was the statement:
"This is who I am. These are my instruments."

Studiolo. Four syllables (STOO-dee-OH-lo). Italian.
Renaissance. Private. Intellectual. A room of one's own.

Testing:

- "Check the Studiolo." — Formal.
- "I'm in the Studiolo preparing for the engagement." ✓
  This one SINGS. Because that's what a studiolo IS.

But: four syllables, Italian, might feel pretentious.
And "studiolo" is uncommon enough that most people would
need it explained. Not immediately evocative.

**Scriptorium** — Where manuscripts were written and
copied in medieval monasteries. Five syllables. And it
implies copying, not original work. No.

**Sanctum** — Sacred, private place. But comic book
associations (Doctor Strange). And religious overtones.

---

## What About Nature-Workshop Hybrids?

The Grove names things with nature words. Heartwood,
Canopy, Meadow, Foliage. What if the workshop has a
nature name? What natural structure serves as a private
workspace at the edge of a forest?

**Hollow** — A natural cavity in a tree or hillside.
Animals shelter in hollows. Warm, protected, hidden.
But: the word itself means "empty." And "Sleepy Hollow"
dominates the association.

**Den** — An animal's lair. Warm, cozy. But too generic.
Used everywhere. `AutumnsGrove/Den` feels too small.

**Lodge** — A shelter in the wilderness. Where a ranger
stays. Strong, but implies communal space.

**Holt** — An otter's den. Also Old English for "small
wood." Beautiful but too obscure.

**Hearth** — The fireplace at the center of a home.
Medieval. Universally warm. But too close to "Heartwood"
phonetically. And it's a part of a room, not the room.

---

## The Keep vs The Bottega

Two finalists for "the room":

**Keep** — The strongest tower in a castle. Where you
KEEP things. The verb IS the noun. Clean. One syllable.
But: too military. Too stone-and-iron. Not warm enough.

**Bottega** — The master's workshop. Literally "workshop"
in Italian. Three syllables. Da Vinci's actual workspace
was called his bottega. THE word for a Renaissance
craftsperson's professional home base.

The apprentice concern is overblown — bottega just means
workshop. The direction concern was wrong: Leonardo
PREPARED in the bottega, then went TO patrons' courts.
Exactly what Autumn does.

The Bottega Veneta fashion brand association is weaker
than the Codex/OpenAI overlap. Fashion and tech don't
mix. Context disambiguates.

---

## The Room Is the Bottega

Testing with intent:

- "I'm in the Bottega preparing for the engagement." ✓
- "The Bestiary is in the Bottega." ✓ ← Key sentence.
  The book of beasts lives inside the workshop.
- "Check the Bottega for the engagement runbook." ✓
- "I updated the Bottega with new templates." ✓
- "Open the Bottega and run the Raven." ✓

`AutumnsGrove/Bottega` — three syllables (bot-TAY-ga).

The Bottega contains:

- The Bestiary (the catalog of animal skills)
- The instruments (Osprey's estimation calipers)
- The documents (agreement, proposal, cheat sheet)
- The runbook (the engagement playbook)
- The archives (client records, quotes)

It IS the workshop. Not a metaphor. Not an analogy.
The specific Renaissance Italian word for the kind of
workshop where Da Vinci prepared his masterworks.

The Bestiary lives in the Bottega.
The instruments live in the Bottega.
The documents live in the Bottega.
The Wayfinder prepares in the Bottega.
She ventures out. She returns. She annotates.
The Bottega grows.

| --------------------------- | --------- |
| Means "workshop"            | literally |
| Medieval/Renaissance        | YES       |
| Da Vinci's actual workspace | YES       |
| A PLACE (not a book/object) | YES       |
| Can contain the Bestiary    | YES       |
| Warm and inviting           | YES       |
| Clean in tech namespace     | YES       |
| Three syllables, musical    | YES       |
| Private/personal            | YES       |
| Facing outward              | YES       |

Bottega Veneta concern: weaker than Codex/OpenAI.
Different industries. Context makes it Grove's word.

Naming pattern concern (Italian vs English): Lattice
isn't a nature word either. And "Bottega" earns its
place — it's THE word for this concept.

## Leaving the Workshop

Autumn says: let's get out of Da Vinci's workshop.
Let's move to a library. The Library of Alexandria.

Good. The bottega was getting small. Four walls.
One window. The smell of linseed oil was nice but
I was circling the same table. Let me step outside,
cross the Mediterranean, and walk into the largest
building the ancient world ever knew.

---

## The Library of Alexandria

Picture it. Not the Hollywood version — not a single
room with scrolls on shelves. The REAL thing.

The Library of Alexandria wasn't a library. It was a
CAMPUS. The Mouseion (Μουσεῖον) — the "Seat of the
Muses." A research institution. A university. A think
tank. The greatest concentration of knowledge the
ancient world ever assembled.

Founded around 283 BCE by Ptolemy I. Part of the royal
palace complex in the Bruchion quarter of Alexandria.

What it contained:

- The Great Library (the main collection)
- The Serapeum (the "daughter library")
- Lecture halls and meeting rooms
- Gardens and covered walkways (colonnades)
- A dining hall where scholars ate together
- A zoo (for studying animals!)
- A botanical garden (for studying plants!)
- An observatory
- Rooms for dissection and study

At its peak: 400,000 to 700,000 scrolls. Every ship
that docked in Alexandria's harbor had its scrolls
confiscated, copied, and (sometimes) returned. The
library kept the originals.

Scholars LIVED there. The Ptolemaic kings paid their
salaries, fed them, housed them. In exchange, the
scholars researched, wrote, organized, and — crucially
— CATALOGED. Callimachus created the Pinakes, the
first library catalog. 120 scrolls just to INDEX the
other scrolls.

The parallels are strong. But what NAME does this
place give us?

---

## Words from Alexandria

**Mouseion / Museum** — "Seat of the Muses." The
original meaning was a research institution, not a
display hall. But "museum" has been domesticated —
it means "place where old things sit behind glass."
Can't reclaim it.

**Athenaeum** — Temple of Athena. Place of learning.
Three or four syllables. Testing: "Check the
Athenaeum." — Too grand. You're wearing a toga. Not
cozy enough for Grove.

**Stoa** — A covered walkway where philosophers taught.
Open on one side (facing outward!). But too open —
a stoa doesn't contain things. It's a fancy porch.

**Lyceum** — Aristotle's school. But "lyceum" means
"school" in most people's minds. Too institutional.

**Pinakes** — Callimachus's catalog. But we need a
place, not a document. And too obscure.

**Bibliotheca** — Greek for "book repository." Five
syllables. Beautiful but too long.

None of these land. Let me look at the STRUCTURE.

---

## Inside the Library

The scrolls were stored in **armaria** — closed
cabinets or pigeonholes. From Latin arma (tools,
equipment). The armarium was a ROOM in medieval
monasteries — the book storage room tended by the
armarius (the librarian-monk).

This leads to: **Armory** — a place where arms and
tools are stored. Where you gear up before going out.
Medieval. Three syllables.

Testing:

- "I'm in the Armory gearing up." ✓
- "The Bestiary is in the Armory." ✓

But: too military. Too aggressive. An armory is stone
and iron, not wood and candlelight. The Grove is warm.

---

## The Apothecary Detour

From Alexandria, through the Arabic Golden Age, the
knowledge migrated. And something interesting emerges:

**Apothecary** — A medieval/Renaissance pharmacy.
Floor to ceiling: labeled wooden drawers. Glass jars
of dried herbs, minerals, tinctures. A mortar and
pestle. Scales for precise measurement. A reference
book on a stand. One practitioner who knows her craft.

The parallel is startling:

- Client arrives with an ailment (security problem)
- Apothecary consults references (Bestiary)
- Selects remedies (Raven, Osprey, Turtle)
- Measures precisely (Osprey's estimation)
- Prepares treatment (proposal, engagement)
- Dispenses the cure (remediation)
- Records the treatment (archives)

The VIBE is perfect. But six syllables. And the
direction is wrong — an apothecary's clients come
to HER. Autumn goes to THEM.

Hold the feeling. Release the word.

---

## What the Alexandria Walk Taught Us

The Library of Alexandria didn't give us THE name.
But it clarified what we're looking for:

The right word must be:

1. A PLACE (a room, a building, a structure)
2. Where a single practitioner PREPARES
3. That contains organized tools and references
4. With the feeling of: warm, candlelit, personal,
   curated, precise, organized-but-alive
5. 1-3 syllables (4 maximum)
6. Not poisoned by tech/pop culture
7. Works as `AutumnsGrove/___`

And the Alexandria walk gave us a new image to add
to the Da Vinci workshop: the apothecary. Labeled
drawers. Glass jars. Precise measurement. Remedies
for specific ailments. One practitioner.

The room we're naming is a Da Vinci workshop crossed
with an apothecary shop. Tools AND remedies. Invention
AND healing. Preparation AND dispensing.

The walk continues.

## The Rice Fields of China

Leave the library. Leave the Mediterranean entirely.
Walk east. Past Constantinople, past the Silk Road
caravanserais, past the Himalayas. Into southern China.
Yunnan province. The Honghe Hani Rice Terraces.

Stand at the top. It's early morning.

Mist rises from the flooded paddies. Each terrace
reflects the sky — hundreds of irregular mirrors
stepping down the mountainside. The forest is above
you, dark and ancient. Below, the terraces cascade
toward the valley floor. A heron stands in the shallow
water of one paddy, perfectly still, watching for fish.

This landscape was built by hand. Not in one season.
Not in one generation. Over CENTURIES. Each terrace
dug, leveled, walled with stone, connected to the
irrigation system. The water starts at the top and
flows down through every level, feeding each paddy
in turn, until it reaches the bottom and returns to
the stream.

No single person designed this. No Leonardo sketched
it on vellum. It grew. Generation after generation of
farmers, each one adding a terrace, reinforcing a wall,
deepening a channel. The system is older than any
individual memory. And it will outlive every person
working it today.

The energy here is completely different from Da Vinci's
workshop. That was INVENTION — a single genius with a
candle, sketching a flying machine. This is CULTIVATION.
Patient. Cyclical. Seasonal. Water-based, not fire-based.
The same work, done well, year after year, building on
what came before.

---

## The Cultivator's Building

At the top of the terraces, where the forest meets
the fields, there's a building. Not grand. Not a
library. Not a workshop with brass instruments. A
solid, weathered structure. Thick walls — stone and
timber. A heavy door.

Inside: tools hang from pegs on the wall. A sickle.
A flail. Winnowing baskets. Rope. On a shelf: jars
of seed stock for next season, labeled by variety and
year. A logbook — handwritten, going back decades.
Notes about drainage patterns, pest outbreaks, which
terrace needs reinforcing. A map of the entire terrace
system pinned to the wall, annotated in different inks
from different seasons.

This is where the cultivator prepares. Where she
records. Where she plans the next season based on the
last one. Where the tools are maintained and the
knowledge is kept.

And when the rice is harvested, it comes HERE first.
Raw and rough, still in the husk. She threshes it.
Winnows it. Husks it. The refined grain goes into
storage. The chaff goes back to the fields as mulch.

Raw material comes in. Refined product goes out.
The building is the PROCESSING space.

That's the freelance workshop:

- Client repo comes in (raw, in the husk)
- The Raven investigates (threshing — separating
  what matters from what doesn't)
- The Osprey appraises (measuring the yield)
- Documents are prepared (refined grain — proposals,
  agreements, reports)
- Deliverables go out (clean rice, packaged)
- Records are archived (the logbook grows)

---

## The Scholar's Study

In Chinese literati culture, there's a parallel
tradition: the scholar's 書房 (shū fáng) — literally
"book room." Private. Contemplative. Sacred.

The scholar's study held the 文房四寶 — the Four
Treasures of the Study: brush, ink, paper, inkstone.
Without any one of them, the scholar cannot work.

The Wayfinder's Four Treasures:

1. The Bestiary (the animal skills)
2. The Documents (agreement, proposal, cheat sheet)
3. The Runbook (engagement playbook)
4. The Archives (client records, history)

These four things live in the room we're naming.
The room holds the treasures. The treasures enable
the practice. The practice sustains the practitioner.

---

## What the Rice Fields Teach

Da Vinci's workshop: precision, craft, tools. Fire.
Alexandria: organization, cataloging, remedies. Stone.
Rice fields teach something new: patience, cycles,
cultivation. Water.

**1. The work is cyclical, not one-time.**
Each engagement is a season. You prepare, plant, tend,
harvest. Then you prepare again.

**2. Patience matters more than speed.**
The Raven doesn't rush. The Osprey hovers. The work
takes the time it takes.

**3. Water, not fire.**
The freelance practice is more water than fire. It
flows around obstacles. It finds the level. It reflects
the sky.

**4. The landscape is engineered but looks natural.**
The terraces are artificial — dug by hand. But they
curve with the mountain. Engineered nature. The Grove
aesthetic, exactly.

**5. Each season builds on the last.**
The logbook grows. The terrace walls strengthen. The
seed stock improves. Each engagement makes the next
one smoother.

**6. The practitioner tends the same space.**
She doesn't move to a new field. She tends the same
terraces, year after year. The workshop stays. The
tools stay. The knowledge accumulates.

---

## But What's the WORD?

The rice field walk gave us atmosphere and philosophy.
It shifted the energy from invention to cultivation,
from fire to water, from one-time genius to seasonal
practice. But it didn't hand us a single word.

Testing rice-field-adjacent words:

**Granary** — where harvested rice is stored. A PLACE.
But too storage-focused. You don't WORK in a granary.

**Mill** — where raw grain is processed. A PLACE.
But too industrial. Mass production, not craft.

**Terrace** — one level of the engineered landscape.
But "terrace" in English means restaurant patio.

**Paddy** — a flooded rice field. Too casual, and
it's where the WORK happens, not where you PREPARE.

The Chinese words for workshop (工坊, 書房, 庄) are
beautiful in their language but don't carry warmth
into English.

---

## Where We Stand After Three Walks

| Walk                | Taught Us            | Gave Us            |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Da Vinci's workshop | Craft, precision     | Bottega, Bestiary  |
| Alexandria          | Cataloging, remedies | Apothecary (vibe)  |
| Rice fields         | Patience, cycles     | Cultivation energy |

The combined feeling for this room:
Patient. Precise. Organized but alive. Warm. Personal.
Where a practice is cultivated over seasons. Not grand.
Not institutional. Not a single burst of genius. The
cultivator returns to the same space, year after year,
refining her craft. Each engagement is a season. The
logbook grows.

The word we need lives at the intersection of:
**workshop + sanctuary + seasonal practice**

**Still standing:** Bottega (the master's workshop)

The walk continues.
