# Naming Journey: The Freelance Workbench

## What We're Naming

A standalone repo that holds Autumn's entire freelance practice:

- The Raven (security audit skill)
- The Osprey (project estimation skill)
- Documents (services agreement, proposal template, scope cheat sheet, runbook)
- The complete client engagement pipeline
- Future: client records, quote archives, before/after reports

This is the Wayfinder's personal toolkit for work she does OUTSIDE
the grove — freelance security consulting for other people's codebases.

This thing sits at the EDGE of the grove. It faces outward.
It's where the Wayfinder keeps her tools for venturing into
other people's forests.

## What IS This Thing?

**Fundamentally:** A workspace. A preparation space. Home base.

**What it does in the user's life:**

- Stores tools (Raven, Osprey skills)
- Stores documents (agreement, proposal, cheat sheet, runbook)
- Houses the pipeline (inquiry → audit → quote → deliver)
- Is where you return between client engagements

**What emotion should it evoke:**

- Preparedness ("I'm ready for this")
- Professional confidence ("I have a system")
- Warmth ("this is MY space, my home base")
- Competence ("everything I need is right here")

**Key characteristic:**
The Raven and Osprey are BIRDS. Birds of prey. They hunt,
they return. They need a home base. This is it.

## Walking Through...

I enter the grove. I walk past the Meadow where others gather.
I check on my tree — my blog, my space, my home.

But today I'm not writing. Today I'm working.

I walk to the edge of the grove, where the forest meets open
sky. There's a structure here — not quite a cabin, not quite
a tower. Something built for a purpose.

The Raven is perched outside, preening. It just got back from
investigating a client's Django app. The Osprey is inside,
turning the case file into a proposal.

I step inside. My tools are organized on hooks. My documents
are filed. The runbook is pinned to the wall. There's a desk
where I do my planning.

This is where I prepare before flying out. Where the birds
come home. Where the catches are sorted and the next hunt
is planned.

What is this place?

## Candidates

### 1. Roost

**The home base where the birds return.**

- In nature: Where birds rest, sleep, and shelter between flights.
  Communal — multiple birds share a roost. Protected. High up.
- Why it fits: The Raven and Osprey are birds. They hunt (audit,
  estimate), they return to the Roost with their catches (case
  files, proposals). It's the home base.
- The vibe: Cozy, warm, competent. Like a well-organized workshop
  with birds perched on the rafters.
- Tagline test: "Roost is where the birds come home."
- Potential issues: Could sound sleepy? But "roosting" also implies
  watchfulness — birds roost in high places to keep watch.

### 2. Mews

**Where trained hunting birds are kept between hunts.**

- In nature: In falconry, the mews is the building where hawks
  and falcons live between hunts. They're fed, cared for, and
  prepared for the next flight. The word comes from "mew" meaning
  to molt — a place of transformation and renewal.
- Why it fits: THE most precise metaphor. The Raven and Osprey
  are trained hunting birds. The Mews is where they're kept
  between client engagements. Historical, specific, perfect.
- The vibe: Sophisticated, professional, niche knowledge.
  Falconry meets freelancing.
- Tagline test: "The Mews — where the hunting birds wait."
- Potential issues: Might be too obscure. Also associated with
  London real estate (mews houses). Autumn might not know the
  word, which could make it feel disconnected.

### 3. Bower

**A carefully constructed space, curated with intention.**

- In nature: Bowerbirds build elaborate decorated structures to
  attract mates — the most architecturally ambitious birds in
  nature. Also: a sheltered garden alcove, or a lady's private
  chamber in medieval times.
- Why it fits: The freelance workbench IS a carefully curated
  collection of tools, documents, and workflows designed to
  attract clients and demonstrate professionalism. Built with
  care. Decorated with intention.
- The vibe: Artistic, intentional, quietly impressive.
- Tagline test: "Bower is where you build something worth seeing."
- Potential issues: The bowerbird connection is about attracting
  mates, which could feel weird for a professional context.
  Also "bower" can feel overly gentle for security work.

### 4. Aerie

**A raptor's high nest.**

- In nature: The nest of a bird of prey, typically on a cliff
  edge or tall tree. Eagles, hawks, osprey all build aeries.
  A vantage point. Commanding. Safe.
- Why it fits: The Osprey literally builds aeries. The Raven
  nests high. It's a bird-of-prey specific word that captures
  "home base with a view." Professional, elevated.
- The vibe: Strong, elevated, clear-sighted. Like standing
  on a cliff edge looking out at the landscape of opportunity.
- Tagline test: "The Aerie — your vantage point above the work."
- Potential issues: Might feel too serious/corporate for "cute."
  Also pronounced "AIR-ee" or "EER-ee" — potential confusion.

### 5. Rookery

**A colony of crows/ravens.**

- In nature: A rookery is a nesting colony of rooks (corvids,
  like ravens) or other social birds. A bustling, organized,
  noisy base of operations.
- Why it fits: Directly connects to the Raven. A rookery is
  where ravens gather, plan, and prepare. It's communal and
  busy — fitting for a workspace with multiple tools and docs.
- The vibe: Atmospheric, slightly mysterious, Victorian-gothic.
- Tagline test: "The Rookery — where the ravens gather."
- Potential issues: "Rookery" historically also means a slum
  or crowded tenement (Victorian England). Slightly dark connotation.

## The Walk Continues...

I'm standing at the edge of the grove. The Raven caws from
the rafters. The Osprey shifts on its perch, eyes on the river.

This place is practical. It's not fancy. It's organized.
Everything has its hook, its shelf, its purpose.

It's a ROOST.

Not an aerie — that's too dramatic.
Not a mews — that's too obscure.
Not a bower — that's too artistic.
Not a rookery — that's too dark.

A roost is simple. Warm. Functional. One syllable.
The birds come home to the roost.
You come home to the roost between gigs.
Your tools live in the roost.

## The Name: Roost

**Where the birds come home.** · `AutumnsGrove/Roost`

At the edge of the grove, where the forest meets open sky,
there's a sturdy structure with wide eaves and high perches.
The Raven returns here after investigating unfamiliar codebases,
dropping its case file on the desk. The Osprey brings the catch
— client proposals, priced with precision. Between engagements,
the Wayfinder sits here, sharpening tools, organizing documents,
preparing for the next flight.

The Roost isn't part of the grove's infrastructure. It faces
outward. It's where you do the work that happens beyond your
own forest — freelance security consulting, code audits,
client engagements. Everything you need is here: the skills,
the documents, the pipeline, the archives.

_The birds always come home._

## Tagline Options

1. "Where the birds come home."
2. "Sharpen your talons."
3. "The Wayfinder's freelance toolkit."
4. "Prepare. Fly. Return."
5. "Home base for the hunt."

My pick: **"Where the birds come home."**

## Conflict Check

- "Roost" does not appear as an existing Grove service name
- Does not conflict with any existing concept
- One syllable, clean, memorable
- `AutumnsGrove/Roost` — clean GitHub repo name
- The word "roost" connects naturally to Raven + Osprey
