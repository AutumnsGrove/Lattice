# Naming Journey: The Freelance Workbench

## What We're Naming

A standalone repo that holds Autumn's entire freelance practice:

- The Raven (security audit skill)
- The Osprey (project estimation skill)
- Documents (services agreement, proposal template, scope cheat sheet, runbook)
- The complete client engagement pipeline
- Future: client records, quote archives, before/after reports

This is the Wayfinder's personal toolkit for work she does OUTSIDE
the grove — freelance security consulting for other people's codebases.

This thing sits at the EDGE of the grove. It faces outward.
It's where the Wayfinder keeps her tools for venturing into
other people's forests.

## What IS This Thing?

**Fundamentally:** A workspace. A preparation space. Home base.

**What it does in the user's life:**

- Stores tools (Raven, Osprey skills)
- Stores documents (agreement, proposal, cheat sheet, runbook)
- Houses the pipeline (inquiry → audit → quote → deliver)
- Is where you return between client engagements

**What emotion should it evoke:**

- Preparedness ("I'm ready for this")
- Professional confidence ("I have a system")
- Warmth ("this is MY space, my home base")
- Competence ("everything I need is right here")

**Key characteristic:**
The Raven and Osprey are BIRDS. Birds of prey. They hunt,
they return. They need a home base. This is it.

---

## Direction Change: Da Vinci's Workshop

Roost didn't land. Birds are the wrong metaphor for the
CONTAINER. The animals are what's inside — the Raven, the
Osprey — but the space itself should evoke something different.

New direction: **the machinery of Da Vinci's workshop.**
Medieval. Gears and parchment. Candlelight on brass instruments.
The inventor's table where mechanisms are designed, where
blueprints become reality.

Not a nest. A **workshop**. A place of craft and invention.

## Walking Through... (Take Two)

I enter the grove. I walk past the Meadow, past the trees,
past everything familiar.

At the edge of the forest, where the old oaks lean apart,
there's a stone building half-hidden by ivy. Older than the
grove itself. A heavy oak door, iron-banded, slightly ajar.

I push it open. Candlelight. The smell of parchment and
linseed oil. A long workbench runs the length of the room,
covered in documents — agreements, proposals, case files.
Brass instruments gleam in the light: calipers for measuring
scope, scales for weighing estimates.

On the wall, a mechanism — gears interlocking. The pipeline.
Each gear turns the next: Inquiry drives Assessment, which
drives the Audit, which drives the Quote. Clockwork.

In the corner, leather-bound volumes. The Codex of past
engagements. The Grimoire of skills. The Ledger of hours.

This isn't a nest. It's a WORKSHOP. A place where the
Wayfinder crafts the instruments of her trade. Medieval in
its bones. Da Vinci in its ambition. Every tool designed
with precision, every document written with care.

The animals come and go — the Raven with its case files,
the Osprey with its estimates — but the WORKSHOP endures.
It was here before them. It will outlast any single engagement.

What is this place called?

---

## Candidates

### 1. Codex

**The master's collected knowledge, bound and organized.**

- In history: Da Vinci's Codex Atlanticus, Codex Leicester,
  Codex Arundel — his most famous legacy. Each one a bound
  collection of notes, sketches, plans, and inventions. The
  organized knowledge of the master.
- **The etymology:** Latin _cōdex_ literally means "tree trunk"
  or "block of wood." Wood → writing tablet → bound book →
  collected knowledge. The word itself bridges TREE and
  MANUSCRIPT. It was born in the grove.
- Why it fits: Your freelance toolkit IS a codex — a bound
  collection of professional knowledge. The runbook, the
  agreement, the cheat sheet, the proposal template. Every
  skill, every document, every pipeline step. Organized.
  Precious. Referenced constantly.
- The vibe: Scholarly, warm, weighty. Something you'd find
  on a shelf in a candlelit workshop, spine cracked from use.
- Tagline test: "Codex — the collected works."
- `AutumnsGrove/Codex` — clean, strong.
- Potential issues: Common in gaming/tech. But in Grove's
  ecosystem, where every name has a nature etymology, the
  tree-trunk origin recontextualizes it completely.

### 2. Bottega

**The Italian Renaissance workshop.**

- In history: A _bottega_ was the workshop of a master artist
  in Renaissance Italy. Da Vinci trained in Verrocchio's bottega
  in Florence. Apprentices learned, tools were shared, and
  masterworks were born from a single room. The word itself
  means "shop" or "workshop" — the place where the craft lives.
- Why it fits: This IS a workshop. Not a library, not a vault —
  a working space where things are made. Proposals are drafted.
  Estimates are calculated. Skills are honed. The bottega is
  alive with work.
- The vibe: Warm, Italian, artisanal. Sawdust and linseed oil.
  The master at her bench. Inviting without being precious.
- Tagline test: "Bottega — where the craft lives."
- `AutumnsGrove/Bottega` — distinctive, memorable.
- Potential issues: Italian word — might need pronunciation
  help (boh-TAY-gah). Also: Bottega Veneta (fashion brand)
  might create associations. But the Renaissance meaning is
  stronger and older.

### 3. Forge

**Where raw material becomes something useful.**

- In history: The blacksmith's forge — fire, anvil, hammer.
  Where ore becomes blade. Where raw findings become polished
  proposals. Medieval, universal, elemental.
- Why it fits: The Raven brings raw findings. The Osprey forges
  them into proposals. The documents are forged — shaped by
  heat and precision into something clients can hold. The forge
  is transformation.
- The vibe: Strong, elemental, warm (literally — fire). Simple.
  One syllable.
- Tagline test: "Forge — shape the work."
- `AutumnsGrove/Forge` — clean, punchy.
- Potential issues: VERY common in tech (GitHub had Forge,
  Atlassian has Forge, SourceForge...). Might feel generic.
  Also leans aggressive — hammers and fire might clash with
  Grove's gentle nature aesthetic.

### 4. Grimoire

**A book of invocations.**

- In history: A grimoire is a medieval textbook of magic —
  instructions for invoking spirits, crafting talismans, and
  performing rituals. Each entry is a detailed procedure.
  Follow the steps exactly. The invocation works.
- Why it fits: Your skills ARE invocations. `/raven-investigate`
  — invoke the Raven. `/osprey-appraise` — invoke the Osprey.
  The runbook is literally a step-by-step ritual. The cheat
  sheet is a protection spell. The proposal template is a
  summoning circle for client trust. You open the grimoire,
  follow the procedure, and the magic happens.
- The vibe: Mysterious, powerful, a little witchy. Candlelight
  on old pages. Handwritten marginalia. Dog-eared from use.
- Tagline test: "Grimoire — invoke the craft."
- `AutumnsGrove/Grimoire` — atmospheric, memorable.
- Potential issues: "Magic" framing might undercut the
  professionalism. Also slightly dark/occult — though Grove
  already has Thorn, Shade, and animal invocations, so the
  ecosystem can hold it. Three syllables (GRIM-wahr).

### 5. Almanac

**The practitioner's reference for all seasons.**

- In history: Medieval almanacs were indispensable reference
  books — astronomical tables, planting calendars, weather
  predictions, medical advice. Farmers, sailors, and merchants
  carried them everywhere. A practical compendium for
  navigating the year's work.
- Why it fits: Your toolkit IS an almanac — a reference for
  every season of client work. When to quote (the Osprey
  tables). When to audit (the Raven procedures). What to
  charge (the pricing tables). How to handle scope creep
  (the defense scripts). Consult the almanac before every
  engagement. It has the answer.
- The vibe: Practical, worn, beloved. Tucked into a coat
  pocket. Referenced so often the spine is soft. Annotated
  in the margins with personal notes.
- Tagline test: "Almanac — for every season of work."
- `AutumnsGrove/Almanac` — warm, familiar.
- Potential issues: Might feel too "book" and not enough
  "workshop." An almanac is something you READ. A workshop
  is something you WORK IN. But the freelance toolkit is
  honestly more reference-book than workshop — you consult
  it, follow its procedures, use its templates.

## The Walk Continues...

I'm standing in the workshop. Candlelight flickers on the
walls. The gears of the pipeline mechanism turn slowly.

On the workbench: a leather-bound volume. Heavy. The cover
is embossed. Inside: sketches and procedures. The Raven's
investigation protocol. The Osprey's estimation tables.
The scope cheat sheet. The client agreement. Everything
the Wayfinder needs, bound together.

I pick it up. It's warm in my hands. Well-used. Annotated.
Some pages are worn thin from reference. The pricing tables
have pencil marks in the margins — adjustments from past
engagements. The red flags section has new entries added in
different inks, from different seasons.

This isn't just a toolkit. It's a living document. A
practitioner's manual that grows with experience. Every
engagement teaches something new, and the new knowledge
gets added.

What do you call a bound collection of a master's knowledge,
grown over years of practice, rooted in the oldest wood?

---

## Codex: Back Pocket

Codex is a beautiful word. The tree-trunk etymology is
perfect. But OpenAI speared it — "Codex" now means "AI
coding platform" in most developers' minds. Standing in
the middle of that fight isn't worth it. The word is
preserved but not chosen.

---

## Speaking with Da Vinci

I need to stop naming from a DISTANCE and get INTO the
workshop. What was it actually LIKE?

Leonardo's workshop in Milan. The Corte Vecchia, 1490s.

Picture the room. It's not organized. It's a majestic
mess. On the workbench: a half-dissected bird wing pinned
open next to a sketch of a flying machine. Mathematical
tables stacked on top of anatomical drawings. A human skull
sits next to a glass of wine. Mirrors everywhere — he
writes backwards, left-handed, everything mirrored so no
one can read his notes over his shoulder.

In one corner: a wooden model of a gear mechanism, half
assembled. The gears don't mesh yet. He's working out a
problem in three dimensions.

On the wall: a preparatory cartoon for a painting that
was commissioned two years ago and still isn't finished.
The client has written three letters. Leonardo hasn't
responded to any of them. (He will, eventually. The work
will be transcendent. But not today.)

Scattered across every surface: NOTEBOOKS. Not organized
by topic. A single page might contain:

- A study of water flowing around a stone
- A note about purchasing linseed oil
- A sketch of a siege weapon
- A diagram of the muscles of the human arm
- A reminder that "the sun does not move"

The notebooks are the thing. Not the workshop. Not the
tools. THE NOTEBOOKS. They're where Leonardo THINKS.
Where observations become connections. Where a bird's
wing becomes a flying machine. Where a river's current
becomes a hydraulic pump.

But we can't use "codex."

So what ELSE was in that workshop?

## BESTIARY.

A bestiary is a medieval illustrated compendium of beasts.

Each page: a creature. Drawn in detail. Its nature
described. Its habits cataloged. Its meaning explained.
Real animals alongside mythical ones — the lion and the
unicorn shared the same pages. What mattered wasn't
whether the creature was "real." What mattered was what
it MEANT. What it could DO. How to work with it.

Bestiaries were among the most popular books in medieval
Europe. Second only to the Bible. Monks illustrated them
with gold leaf. Scholars annotated them in the margins.
Travelers carried them. Every educated person owned one.

Da Vinci drew animals obsessively. Horses, birds, cats,
dragons. He studied their anatomy, their movement, their
mechanics. He understood: to build a flying machine, you
must first understand the beast that flies.

Now look at what's in this repo:

     Illustrated. Annotated.
     Every beast, cataloged.
```

It's not a codex of knowledge. It's not a workshop of
tools. It's a BESTIARY. A catalog of creatures — each
one illustrated, each one described, each one invoked
for a specific purpose.

The skills ARE the beasts. The Raven. The Osprey. The
Raccoon. The Turtle. The Spider. The Beaver. Each one
has a nature. Each one has habits. Each one has a page
in the book.

And the documents? They're the MARGINALIA. The
practitioner's annotations. The notes scrawled between
the beast entries: "When facing a Django app, invoke
the Raven first, then the Osprey. Budget 15% extra.
Here is the agreement template. Here is the cheat
sheet for red flags."

**This is the only name that bridges BOTH naming worlds
in the Grove ecosystem:** the animal skills AND the
medieval workshop. A bestiary is LITERALLY a medieval
book of animals. It's the intersection of everything.

## Testing "Bestiary"

**Sentence tests:**

- "Open the Bestiary." ✓ Evocative. Immediate.
- "Check the Bestiary for the Raven protocol." ✓
- "I added a new beast to the Bestiary." ✓ LOVE this.
- "The Bestiary has the engagement runbook." ✓
- "Consult the Bestiary before the client call." ✓

**Tagline tests:**

- "A book of beasts." — Clean. Perfect. Done.
- "Every creature, cataloged." — Precise.
- "Know your beasts." — Punchy.
- "The creatures within." — Mysterious.

**Repo name:** `AutumnsGrove/Bestiary` — distinctive,
memorable, immediately evocative.

**The vibe:** You pull a heavy, leather-bound book from
the shelf. The cover is embossed with animal figures.
Inside, each page is an illustration: the Raven with
its magnifying glass, the Osprey hovering over a river
of numbers, the Turtle carrying its shell of defenses.
Between the beast entries, handwritten notes in the
margins — pricing tables, red flag lists, client
scripts. Dog-eared pages where you always turn first.
Gold leaf on the section dividers.

Medieval. Da Vinci. Animals. Documents. One word.

## The Name: Bestiary

**A book of beasts.** · `AutumnsGrove/Bestiary`

In medieval Europe, a bestiary was an illustrated
compendium of creatures — each one drawn in careful
detail, its nature described, its purpose explained.
Real animals alongside mythical ones. Lions and unicorns
shared the same gilt-edged pages. What mattered wasn't
taxonomy. What mattered was: what does this creature DO?
How does it behave? When do you call upon it?

Da Vinci filled his notebooks with animal studies.
Horses in motion. Birds in flight. Cats in repose.
He understood that to build a flying machine, you must
first study the beast that flies. The observation
precedes the invention. The bestiary precedes the work.

The Bestiary is the Wayfinder's illustrated catalog of
freelance creatures. Each beast has a page: its nature,
its habits, its invocation. The Raven investigates. The
Osprey appraises. The Raccoon audits. The Turtle hardens.
The Spider weaves. The Beaver builds. Between the beast
entries: the practitioner's marginalia. Pricing tables.
Red flag lists. Client scripts. The services agreement.
The engagement runbook. Everything annotated in different
inks from different seasons.

You don't just READ the Bestiary. You INVOKE it. Open
the page. Speak the name. The beast appears and does
its work. When the work is done, the beast returns to
its page. You annotate what you learned. The Bestiary
grows.

_A book of beasts._

## Conflict Check

- "Bestiary" does not appear as an existing Grove service name
- Does not conflict with any existing concept
- Four syllables (BEST-ee-air-ee) — same length as Terrarium
- `AutumnsGrove/Bestiary` — strong, distinctive repo name
- Bridges the animal skill names with medieval workshop energy
- No tech company has claimed this word
- Immediately evocative — everyone knows what a bestiary is
- The "best" in "bestiary" is a nice accident
