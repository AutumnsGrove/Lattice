# Naming Journey: Comprehensive Security Auditor

## What Is This Thing?

**Fundamentally:**
This is an assessor. An examiner. Something that surveys an entire system — application code, infrastructure, auth flows, data boundaries — and produces a comprehensive judgment of its security posture. It doesn't build. It doesn't patch. It *evaluates*, thoroughly and honestly.

**What does it DO?**
- Threat-models the application to understand what matters most
- Systematically audits every attack surface against OWASP and Grove-specific checklists
- Produces a formal security report with findings, severity ratings, and remediation guidance
- Then (on approval) methodically fixes what it found
- Two passes: assess, then remediate

**What emotion should it evoke?**
- Thoroughness. Patience. Comprehensive vision.
- The feeling of someone who sees *everything* and misses nothing.
- Not aggressive or predatory — methodical, wise, complete.
- You trust this creature because it is unhurried and meticulous.

## Walking Through the Forest

I enter the grove. I see the animals already here...

The Raccoon rummages through drawers, quick and clever — finding secrets, cleaning up.
The Turtle withdraws into its shell, layering defenses — hardening what exists.
The Spider spins webs of auth — connecting, securing, binding.

But none of them *survey the whole forest*. None of them climb high enough to see the entire landscape, assess every path, every boundary, every weak point — and then come back down with a complete map of what needs attention.

I need something with complete vision. Something patient and thorough. Something that surveys from above AND examines up close. Something methodical — not rushing, not cutting corners.

I walk past the Eagle — but the Eagle is an architect, designing systems. I don't need a designer. I need an examiner.

I walk past the Panther — surgical strikes on specific bugs. Too narrow.

I walk past the Fox — speed and performance. Wrong domain entirely.

I need something that...

- Has exceptional vision (sees the whole system)
- Is patient and methodical (thorough assessment)
- Is independent (doesn't need others to do its work)
- Has a reputation as a guardian or sentinel
- Is associated with wisdom and keen observation

## Candidates

**Hawk** 🦅
- Natural meaning: A raptor known for incredibly sharp vision — can spot a mouse from a mile up. Patient hunter that circles high, watching, waiting, seeing everything before acting.
- Why it fits: The hawk surveys from altitude, sees the whole landscape. "Hawk-eyed" means nothing escapes your notice. Hawks are associated with vigilance, sharp assessment, and complete awareness.
- The vibe: Keen, patient, comprehensive. Circling above, missing nothing.
- Potential issues: Eagle already exists as architect. Both are raptors. But Eagle designs — Hawk assesses. The distinction is clear. Eagle soars to envision; Hawk circles to *examine*.

**Wolf** 🐺
- Natural meaning: Pack hunter, intelligent, territorial. Tests boundaries, finds weak points.
- Why it fits: Wolves probe defenses, find where the herd is vulnerable. "Pen testing" has wolf energy.
- The vibe: Predatory, intelligent, relentless.
- Potential issues: Feels too aggressive for Grove's warm aesthetic. Also, wolves are pack animals — this creature works alone.

**Crane** 🦩
- Natural meaning: Tall wading bird. Patient. Stands motionless in water, watching for hours, then strikes precisely.
- Why it fits: Patient observation, precise assessment. Cranes are symbols of vigilance in many cultures (sentinels who stand guard).
- The vibe: Elegant, patient, watchful. Ancient wisdom.
- Potential issues: Less well-known for "vision" than hawks. The crane metaphor is more about patience than comprehensive sight.

**Falcon** 🦅
- Natural meaning: The fastest animal alive. Sharp-eyed, precise. Used in falconry for reconnaissance.
- Why it fits: Precision, keen sight, the idea of releasing a falcon to survey and report back.
- The vibe: Swift, precise, elite.
- Potential issues: Speed isn't really the point — thoroughness is. Falcon suggests quickness, but this creature is deliberate.

## The Tagline Test

"**Hawk** is the keen eye that sees everything."
"The Hawk circles above the grove, surveying every path, every boundary, every shadow."
"Release the Hawk to assess your defenses."

"**Wolf** probes the perimeter, finding where defenses thin."
- Too aggressive.

"**Crane** stands watch, patient and unblinking."
- Beautiful but doesn't convey comprehensiveness.

"**Falcon** returns with what it found."
- Too quick, too light.

## The Metaphor Chain

The Hawk circles high above the grove. From altitude, it sees the full terrain — every path a wanderer might walk, every clearing where something could be exposed, every shadow where something might hide. The hawk doesn't rush. It spirals patiently, building a complete picture. Only when it has seen everything does it descend, landing beside the grove keeper to report: "Here is what I found."

The hawk's vision is legendary. It sees what others miss — not because it's smarter, but because it takes the time to look from every angle. It sees the mouse in the tall grass. It sees the fox approaching the henhouse. It sees the gap in the fence that no one else noticed.

And unlike the eagle who designs the fortress, the hawk *assesses* it.

## Selection: **Hawk** 🦅

**hawk-survey** as the skill name.

The Hawk is the comprehensive security auditor. It circles above the entire system — application code, infrastructure, auth flows, data boundaries — and produces a thorough assessment. The Hawk's eye misses nothing.

**Why Hawk:**
1. "Hawk-eyed" is universally understood as "nothing escapes notice"
2. Hawks circle patiently before acting — matches the two-pass approach (assess, then remediate)
3. Hawks survey from altitude (full-system view) AND dive for close inspection (deep analysis)
4. Distinct from Eagle: Eagle designs (architect), Hawk assesses (auditor)
5. The verb "hawk" means to watch vigilantly — "I'll hawk the deployment" = I'll watch it carefully
6. Fits the nature metaphor beautifully — a guardian circling above the grove
