## The Journey

### First Walk: Bark

The initial naming journey explored protective metaphors. "Bark" emerged as the winner: the protective outer layer of every tree, quiet and essential.

But there was a problem. "Bark" also means the sound a dog makes. The association was jarring, aggressive, unwelcoming. Grove is warm. A barking dog is not.

Back to the forest.

### Second Walk: Exploring Alternatives

Five agents walked the grove independently, each exploring different metaphor spaces:

**Boundaries:** Threshold, Edge, Verge
**Earth:** Loam, Tilth, Humus
**Roots:** Taproot, Rootbed
**Shelter:** Bower, Canopy

Three of the five landed on **Loam**.

### Third Walk: The Final Ritual

One more walk through the grove, this time complete with visualization:

```
              ,@@@@,
             @@@@@@@
             |||||||   <-- Every tree in the grove
             |||||||
    _________|||||_________
    .:  .:  .:  .:  .:  .:   <-- LOAM beneath
      The soil that decides
       what can take root
```

---

## Step 1: What IS This Thing?

### The Function

This system:
- Prevents harmful, offensive, and reserved usernames
- Protects the Grove brand and services
- Blocks impersonation attempts
- Filters hate speech and slurs
- Guards against fraud and spam patterns

### What IS it, fundamentally?

It's not a barrier. It's not armor. It's not a guard at the gate.

It's the **foundation**. The thing that exists before anything grows. The medium that determines what can take root.

### What does it DO in the user's life?

- **Filter**: Yes, it filters what can exist in the grove
- **Support**: Yes, it enables healthy growth by preventing poison
- **Exist quietly**: Yes, you never think about soil until something won't grow

### What emotion should it evoke?

- **Foundation**: Solid ground beneath your feet
- **Trust**: What grows here is meant to be here
- **Invisible support**: The grove is healthy because the soil is good
- **Quiet enabling**: Loam doesn't reject. It simply doesn't support what doesn't belong.

---

## Step 2: Walking Through the Forest

*I enter the grove. The path is soft beneath my feet.*

*Soft. Why is it soft?*

*I kneel down and touch the earth. Rich, dark loam. The kind of soil that makes gardeners jealous. This is why the trees here grow so tall, why the meadow flowers bloom so bright.*

*But loam does something else. Not everything can grow in good soil. Weeds that thrive in poor conditions struggle here. Invasive species can't take hold. The very richness of the earth is selective.*

*Someone tries to plant something poisonous. The seed sits there, unable to germinate. The loam doesn't fight it. It just doesn't support it. What doesn't belong quietly fails to take root.*

*This is what I'm looking at.*

---

## Step 3: Nature Metaphors Reconsidered

### Things That Filter (Foundation Layer)

| Metaphor | Description | Vibe |
|----------|-------------|------|
| **Loam** | Rich, balanced soil that supports healthy growth | Foundation, quiet, enabling |
| **Tilth** | Prepared soil ready for planting | Technical, less warm |
| **Humus** | Decomposed organic matter | Too sciency |
| **Rootbed** | Where roots establish | More specific than needed |

### Why Loam Wins

1. **Everyone knows what loam is.** Gardeners, farmers, anyone who's touched good earth. It's accessible.

2. **It's about enabling, not blocking.** Loam doesn't reject. It supports what belongs. That's a warmer framing than "this stops bad things."

3. **It's the foundation.** Every tree in the grove grows from the same earth. The validation system is that foundational.

4. **It's invisible until you need it.** You don't think about soil when your garden thrives. You only notice when something won't grow.

5. **No confusing homonyms.** Unlike "bark," loam only means one thing.

---

## Step 4: The Decision

**Winner: Loam**

### Why Loam?

1. **Foundation metaphor**: Loam is beneath everything. It's the base layer that makes growth possible.

2. **Selective without being aggressive**: Good loam naturally filters. It supports what belongs and quietly doesn't support what doesn't.

3. **Warm and natural**: Soil is nurturing. It's where seeds become trees.

4. **Invisible infrastructure**: You never think about loam. You just enjoy the garden.

5. **Single meaning**: No dogs, no confusion.

### The Shift in Framing

Bark was about protection: "this keeps bad things out."
Loam is about foundation: "this enables good things to grow."

Same function. Warmer metaphor.

## Step 5: The Entry

```markdown
## Loam
**Name Protection** · *Internal service*

Loam is the ideal soil. Rich, dark, perfectly balanced. Sand for drainage,
silt for nutrients, clay for structure. Every gardener knows it. It's what
you want beneath your roots, the foundation that decides what can grow.

Loam is Grove's username and domain validation system. Every name passes
through it before taking root: reserved words, impersonation attempts,
harmful content, fraud patterns. You won't notice it working. That's the
point. Good soil doesn't announce itself. It just quietly ensures that
what grows here belongs here.

*What flourishes starts with what the soil allows.*
```

## Step 6: Visualizing the Final Result

```
              ,@@@@,
             @@@@@@@
             |||||||   <-- Every tree in the grove
             |||||||       grows from the same earth
             |||||||
    _________|||||_________
    .: .: .: .: .: .: .: .:   <-- LOAM
      rich · dark · balanced
    ___________________________
           MYCELIUM
```

**Loam** is the foundation beneath every tree (user/blog) in the grove. Names pass through it before planting (registration). What belongs takes root. What doesn't, simply doesn't.

---

## Final Recommendation

**Name:** Loam
**Internal Name:** GroveLoam
**Tagline:** Name Protection
**Poetic one-liner:** *"What flourishes starts with what the soil allows."*

The name feels **foundational**. Every grove needs good earth.

---

## Icon Recommendation

For Lucide icon, consider:
- `Layers` - soil has layers, foundation concept
- `Mountain` - earth/ground association
- `Sprout` - what grows from good soil

**Recommended:** `Layers` (represents the filtering layers and foundation concept)

*First journey completed: January 7, 2026 — Found: Bark*
*Bark rejected: Dog barking association too jarring*
*Second journey completed: January 7, 2026 — Found: Loam*
*Loam confirmed through convergent selection (3 independent agents chose it)*
