# Naming Journey: Hands-On Dev Sessions

> A Firefly consumer that provisions an ephemeral dev server you access from any browser.
> The hands-on counterpart to Verge.

## What IS This Thing?

**Fundamentally:** A place you climb up to. A workspace in the tree.

**What it does:** Provisions a server with ttyd, code-server, AI tools (opencode, claude code, crush), tunneled through Cloudflare. Accessible from iPad, any browser. Ephemeral but persistent until YOU kill it.

**The defining behavior:** It never auto-fades. You are the idle detector. Everything else in Firefly disappears when idle. This stays. The tree holds your work.

**The metaphor:** "You climb up. You work. You climb back down. The tree remembers where you were."

**Complement to Verge:** Verge is autonomous, brief, gone. This is present, persistent, yours. Verge delegates. This is you, hands-on.

**The emotion:** Focus. Clarity. Settling in. Being physically present in your work, even from an iPad on a couch. The warmth of a good workspace.

## Walking Through the Grove

I'm in the grove. I have my iPad. I want to write code.

I could send work through the Verge and let it come back transformed. Brief, brilliant, gone.

But today I want to be there. I want to watch the tests run. I want to feel the cursor under my fingers. I want to pair with the AI, not delegate to it.

So I climb. Not to the Meadow where others gather. Not to the Canopy where everyone's visible. I climb up into my own tree, to a place that's mine, with my tools laid out, my terminal open, my view clear.

What do I call that place?

Not the canopy (that's where everyone is visible).
Not the meadow (that's the social space).
Not the arbor (that's the admin panel).
Not the clearing (that's the status page).

This is higher. This is personal. This is where I do the work.

## Rejected First Round

The user rejected: **Bough**, **Perch**, **Roost**, **Bower**

Why they didn't land:
- Bough: too passive. Just a branch. No sense of purpose.
- Perch: too bird-specific, feels small and precarious.
- Roost: implies sleeping/resting, not working.
- Bower: ground-level, too enclosed, not elevated enough.

What's missing: something that captures the FEELING, not just the literal location. The best Grove names (Verge, Lumen, Patina, Gossamer) are evocative of texture and feeling, not literal descriptions.

Verge is out THERE → beyond the edge → autonomous
THIS is up HERE → in the tree → hands-on

## Exploring Candidates

### Spire

`gw spire ignite` · `spire.grove.place`

The spire is the topmost point of a tree, the leader branch reaching toward light. In architecture, a spire crowns the structure, visible from everywhere, the highest point of aspiration.

You climb to the spire for the clearest view. Up here, there's nothing between you and the sky. The whole grove spreads below you, and your work has room to breathe.

**Pros:** Elevated, aspirational, 5 letters, one word. "Climb to the spire" writes naturally.
**Cons:** Strong church/architecture associations. Might feel too grand for a dev terminal.

> "Spire is where you climb to see clearly."

---

### Lodge

`gw lodge ignite` · `lodge.grove.place`

A lodge is a structure built with purpose. Beaver lodges are engineering marvels: warm inside, protective, persistent. Mountain lodges are where you arrive after the climb, settle in, and do your work. A lodge keeper tends the space.

You arrive at the lodge. Your tools are waiting. The fire is lit. Work.

**Pros:** Warm, engineered, persistent. Implies comfort and purpose. 5 letters.
**Cons:** Ground-level feeling. Doesn't capture the "climbing up" part. More shelter than vantage point.

> "Lodge is where you settle in to work."

---

### Drey

`gw drey ignite` · `drey.grove.place`

A drey is a squirrel's nest, woven high in the fork of a tree from twigs, leaves, and bark. It's purpose-built, insulated, elevated. The squirrel climbs up to it, works there, sleeps there, stores provisions there. When it leaves, the drey stays.

You climb to your drey. It's exactly where you left it.

**Pros:** Perfectly captures "high in the tree, purpose-built, persistent." 4 letters. Teaches a new word (Grove charm). The squirrel metaphor: nimble, resourceful, always climbing.
**Cons:** Obscure. Most people won't know what it means without explanation. Might feel too cute.

> "Drey is your nest in the canopy."

---

### Loft

`gw loft ignite` · `loft.grove.place`

A loft is an elevated space. A hay loft in a barn. An artist's loft in the city. A sleeping loft in a cabin. You climb a ladder to reach it. The space above, where you go to do focused work away from the ground floor noise.

Climb to the loft. Spread out your tools. Work until you're done.

**Pros:** Universally understood. Exactly the right feeling: elevated, personal, workspace. 4 letters.
**Cons:** Not particularly nature-y. More architectural than forest.

> "Loft is the space above, where the work happens."

---

### Hollow

`gw hollow ignite` · `hollow.grove.place`

A tree hollow is literally where the tree remembers. It's the space left when a branch falls or rots away, healed over into a protected cavity. Animals nest in hollows. They're warm, insulated, persistent. The tree grew around this space on purpose.

Step into the hollow. The tree made this space for you.

**Pros:** "The tree remembers" metaphor is LITERAL in a hollow. Protected, warm, persistent. 6 letters. Nature-first.
**Cons:** "Hollow" also means empty, which undermines the "workspace full of tools" feeling. Not elevated (hollows can be at any height). Slightly melancholy.

> "Hollow is where the tree remembers."

---

### Lookout

`gw lookout ignite` · `lookout.grove.place`

A fire lookout is a small structure built at the highest point in the forest. One person sits there all day, watching, working. Jack Kerouac wrote about his summer as a fire lookout. They're beloved solitary structures with commanding views. Purpose-built for one person doing focused, important work.

Climb to the lookout. Survey the grove. Do the work.

**Pros:** Perfect concept. Elevated, solitary, focused, purpose-built. The history is wonderful.
**Cons:** 7 letters, compound word. "Lookout" is also a warning ("lookout!"). Might feel surveillance-y.

> "Lookout is where one person watches over the grove."

---

## The Tagline Test

> "[Name] is where you ___."

- Spire is where you **climb to see clearly.**
- Lodge is where you **settle in to work.**
- Drey is where you **build your nest and do your work.**
- Loft is where you **spread out and focus.**
- Hollow is where the tree **remembers your work.**
- Lookout is where you **sit and watch the forest.**

## What Pairs Best with Verge?

Verge: the edge, the threshold, the liminal. Brief, brilliant, gone.

- Spire: the peak vs the edge. Aspiration vs liminality. ✓
- Lodge: the shelter vs the edge. Warm vs cold. ✓
- Drey: the nest vs the edge. Home vs away. ✓
- Loft: the elevated vs the edge. Above vs beyond. ✓
- Hollow: the memory vs the edge. Lasting vs fleeting. ✓
- Lookout: the watch vs the edge. Present vs passing. ✓

They all work. The strongest pairings feel like they NEED each other:
- **Verge sends it through. [Name] keeps you there.**

## Gut Check

Which one would I say out loud?

"I'm going to spin up a spire." — natural, clean
"I'm going to open the lodge." — warm but not exciting
"I'm going to climb to my drey." — delightful, personal
"I'm going to head to the loft." — easy, universally understood
"I'm going to step into the hollow." — poetic but heavy
"I'm going to fire up the lookout." — active, purposeful

## The Name: Loft

**Loft** — `loft.grove.place`

A loft is the space above. A hay loft in a barn, warm and filled with the smell of work. An artist's loft in a city building, spread out with tools and light. A sleeping loft in a cabin, where you climb the ladder and the world gets quiet. Every loft shares something: you climb up to reach it. The space is yours. When you climb back down, your work stays.

Loft is a Firefly consumer that provisions an ephemeral dev server you can reach from any browser. Optimized for iPad, accessible from anywhere. You climb to the loft, spread your tools, and work until you're done. The server stays as long as you need it. When you're finished, `gw loft kill` handles everything: pushing uncommitted work, syncing to R2, snapshotting the image, and terminating the server.

Verge sends your code through and it comes back transformed. Loft keeps you there, hands-on, in the elevated quiet where good work happens.

**Firefly Consumer ID:** `loft`
**Internal Name:** GroveLoft
**Domain:** `loft.grove.place` (terminal), `editor.loft.grove.place` (code-server)

> *Climb up. Spread out. The loft holds your work.*
