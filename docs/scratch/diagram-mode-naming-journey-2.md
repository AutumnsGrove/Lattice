# Diagram Mode Naming Journey 2

> Finding the right name for Weave's diagram sub-mode
> Date: January 7, 2026

## The Problem

We're naming the **diagram mode** within Weave (Grove's visual composition studio).

**Context:**
- Animation sub-mode is called **Breeze** (the invisible force that moves through)
- Diagrams are: glass cards with Lucide icons, static relationships, flowcharts, architecture diagrams, entity relationships
- Previous attempts that didn't land:
  - **Trace** — "good but not great", too generic
  - **Dew** — "meh, passive and indifferent" — too delicate, too morning-specific

## What IS This Thing?

### Functionally:
- Glass cards with icons
- Arrows and lines connecting nodes
- Static (NOT animated)
- Shows structure, relationships, architecture
- Makes invisible patterns visible

### What diagrams REALLY are:
- **Maps** — charting territory
- **Blueprints** — showing structure before building
- **Bones** — the skeleton beneath
- **Architecture** — how things are built
- **Foundations** — what everything else rests on

### The Contrast with Breeze:
Breeze moves through invisibly. It's ephemeral, flowing, always in motion.
The diagram mode is the OPPOSITE:
- VISIBLE rather than invisible
- GROUNDED rather than floating
- SOLID rather than flowing
- STRUCTURAL rather than movement
- REVEALS rather than suggests

## Visualizing the Grove

```
                              ☀️
                           🌲   🌲   🌲
                        🌲    🌳    🌲
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
               ROOTS CONNECT BENEATH
                  (mycelium network)

    ABOVE: Breeze moves through the canopy
           Invisible, always flowing

    BELOW: ??? shows the structure
           Visible, grounded, solid
```

## Walking Through the Forest

I'm in Weave, my visual composition studio.
I want to create something that moves, flows, dances.
I choose **Breeze** mode. The air stirs. Things animate.

But now I need something different.
I need to show HOW things connect.
I need to map the architecture.
I need to reveal the structure beneath.

What do I reach for?

I need something that STANDS.
Something SOLID.
Something that shows the BONES of the system.

In nature, what shows structure with intention?

## Candidates to Explore

Let me walk through the forest and see what STANDS and REVEALS...

### Things That Show Structure:

**Stones / Bedrock:**
- Solid, permanent, foundational
- The bones of the earth
- What everything else is built upon
- But feels geological, maybe too static?

**Branches:**
- Literally the structure of trees
- How things connect and diverge
- Visible architecture
- But branches move in the breeze... conflict?

**Bark:**
- The visible surface that protects
- Shows the tree's age and character
- But it's a covering, not structure itself

**Timber / Beams:**
- Cut wood used for building
- Structural, intentional, architectural
- What you build with
- Too human-made? Too construction-focused?

**Roots:**
- The foundation beneath
- Connection and structure
- But roots are HIDDEN, and diagrams make things VISIBLE

**Frost:**
- Makes patterns visible
- Reveals structure through crystallization
- But too cold? Too temporary?

**Lattice:**
- Wait, that's already taken (core platform)
- But the concept is right: framework that supports

**Scaffold:**
- Temporary structure for building
- But not nature-themed enough

### What in nature is BOTH visible AND structural?

**Ridge:**
- The backbone of a mountain
- Visible from distance
- Shows the lay of the land
- Geographic structure made visible

**Grain:**
- The pattern in wood that shows how it grew
- Visible structure
- Natural but reveals architecture
- "Against the grain" / "with the grain"

**Weft:**
- The crosswise threads in weaving
- Creates structure through connection
- But might be too craft-focused?

**Marrow:**
- The essential core
- But hidden inside, not visible

**Frame:**
- Too generic, not nature-themed

**Scaffold:**
- Already considered, too construction

**Cairn:**
- Stacked stones marking a path
- Intentional, visible, structural
- Human-made but using nature
- Guides, shows the way

Let me think more deeply...

## The Key Insight

Breeze is MOVEMENT.
Diagrams are about CONNECTION and STRUCTURE.

In nature, what connects things in a visible, structural way?

**Mycelium** — already taken, and it's invisible
**Ivy** — already taken, and it moves/grows
**Reeds** — already taken, and they sway

What about... the paths themselves?
**Trail** — already taken (roadmaps)

What about geological features?
**Vein** — like mineral veins in rock, visible structure
**Seam** — where things connect
**Ridge** — the spine of landscape

Actually, let me reconsider RIDGE...

## Deep Dive: Ridge

A ridge is:
- The spine of a mountain or hill
- Visible from far away
- Shows the structure of the land
- Where you go for perspective and overview
- The high line that connects peaks
- Natural architecture made visible

In diagrams:
- The backbone of your architecture
- The high-level view
- Structure that connects components
- Where you see how everything fits together

**Ridge** as diagram mode:
- Solid, grounded, structural
- Visible (you can see a ridgeline)
- Shows connection (connects peaks)
- About perspective and overview
- Natural, appropriate weight

Contrast with Breeze:
- Breeze flows THROUGH the valley
- Ridge stands ABOVE as structure

Hmm, but does it feel too geographic? Too masculine/hard?

## Other Directions

What if I think about REVEALING rather than STRUCTURE?

**Dawn:**
- When light reveals what was hidden
- But too temporal, doesn't suggest structure

**Clarity:**
- Too abstract, not nature-themed

**Mirror:**
- Reflects reality
- But not quite right

**Etch:**
- Making marks that reveal
- Like frost on glass
- Creating visible patterns

Actually... ETCH is interesting.

## Deep Dive: Etch

To etch is to carve or mark:
- Frost etches patterns on glass
- Water etches channels in stone
- Time etches lines on bark
- Natural forces making structure VISIBLE

In diagrams:
- You're etching the architecture
- Making invisible relationships visible
- Carving out the structure
- Like frost on glass... glass cards!

**Etch** connects to:
- The glass cards (frost on glass)
- Making patterns visible
- Natural process of revelation
- Deliberate, intentional marking

But is "etch" too craft-y? Too human?

Let me think about what actually etches in nature:
- Frost
- Water (erosion)
- Wind (weathering)
- Time (patina)

Wait... what if the NAME is what does the etching?

**Frost:**
- Makes patterns visible on glass
- Crystallizes into structure
- Natural, beautiful, reveals
- Morning phenomenon (like Dew, but more structural)
- Creates visible architecture

## Deep Dive: Frost

Frost is:
- Crystallized water vapor
- Creates visible patterns
- Makes structure appear on glass
- Delicate but GEOMETRIC
- Reveals through transformation
- Natural but architectural

The magic of frost:
- It REVEALS through STRUCTURE
- It turns invisible (water vapor) into visible (crystals)
- It creates PATTERNS and GEOMETRY
- It appears on GLASS (our glass cards!)
- It's natural but follows mathematical rules

Contrast with Breeze:
- Breeze is invisible air moving
- Frost is visible structure appearing
- Breeze flows
- Frost crystallizes
- Breeze is warm/gentle
- Frost is crisp/clear

Contrast with Dew:
- Dew is droplets, individual, passive
- Frost is PATTERNS, connected, geometric
- Dew just sits there
- Frost CREATES STRUCTURE

This might be it.

## Testing: Frost

**What it means in nature:**
Ice crystals that form on cold surfaces, creating intricate geometric patterns. Most visible on glass, where the crystallization follows natural mathematical rules, creating branches and connections that reveal invisible structure.

**Why it fits diagrams:**
Diagrams are about making invisible architecture visible. Frost does exactly this—it crystallizes invisible vapor into visible geometric patterns. On our glass cards, frost would etch the structure, showing connections and relationships with mathematical precision.

**The vibe:**
Clear, crisp, structural, revealing. Not cold or harsh—think of the beauty of frost on a window. Intricate, geometric, intentional.

**How it pairs with Breeze:**
Perfect contrast. Breeze is warm air moving through space. Frost is crystallized structure appearing on surfaces. One flows, one reveals. One is movement, one is architecture.

**Tagline options:**
- "Where structure crystallizes"
- "Making architecture visible"
- "Patterns that reveal"

**Potential issues:**
- Seasonal (winter-specific)?
  - But Grove embraces seasonality
  - And frost has that quality of REVELATION that transcends season
- Cold?
  - But it's not about temperature, it's about CLARITY
  - Frost is beautiful, not harsh

## Final Test: The Sentence

> "Frost is where invisible architecture becomes visible pattern."

> "In Frost mode, structure crystallizes on glass."

> "Breeze moves through; Frost reveals beneath."

Yes. This feels RIGHT.

## The Decision

**FROST**

It has:
- WEIGHT (more than Dew)
- INTENTION (creates structure, not passive)
- PRESENCE (visible, geometric, architectural)
- NATURE (natural phenomenon)
- CONNECTION to the medium (frost on glass = frost on glass cards)
- Perfect CONTRAST with Breeze

Frost doesn't just sit there like dew. It CREATES. It PATTERNS. It REVEALS.

It's the visible structure that appears when conditions are right.
It's geometry made natural.
It's architecture crystallized from air.

This is the name.

## Grove-Style Entry

### Frost
**The diagram mode of Weave** · Making architecture visible

Frost is what appears on cold glass in the morning: intricate geometric patterns crystallizing from invisible vapor. Each formation is unique, yet follows mathematical rules—branches and connections revealing structure that was always there but couldn't be seen.

In Weave, Frost is where you make invisible architecture visible. Glass cards with icons, connected by lines and arrows, forming flowcharts and relationship diagrams. Static structure made clear. It's not about movement—that's Breeze's domain. Frost is about revealing how things connect, showing the bones of the system, crystallizing complexity into clarity.

*Where invisible architecture becomes visible pattern.*

## Tagline

**"Where structure crystallizes"**

Alternative taglines:
- "Making architecture visible"
- "Patterns that reveal"
- "Geometry from air"

## Why It Works With Breeze

**Breeze** is invisible air in motion. It flows through spaces, moves things, creates animation. It's warm, flowing, ephemeral. You feel it but never see it.

**Frost** is visible structure crystallized. It appears on surfaces, creates patterns, reveals architecture. It's crisp, geometric, intentional. You see it but never feel it moving.

They are perfect opposites that belong together:
- Breeze FLOWS → Frost STANDS
- Breeze is MOVEMENT → Frost is STRUCTURE
- Breeze is INVISIBLE → Frost is VISIBLE
- Breeze ANIMATES → Frost REVEALS
- Breeze passes THROUGH → Frost appears ON

In Weave:
- **Breeze mode**: Things move, flow, animate across your canvas
- **Frost mode**: Structure appears, connections crystallize, architecture becomes visible

Both are natural phenomena. Both transform air into something meaningful. One through motion, one through form.

*The invisible force that moves through. The visible pattern that reveals.*
