# User Directory Naming Journey

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Concept:** An opt-in user directory / phone book for Grove. Wanderers enable visibility in settings, write a custom tagline, pick categories, and appear on a public page in Landing where others can browse and find them.

---

## What IS This Thing?

**Fundamentally:** A place. A listing. A collective display.
**What it does in the user's life:** Connects. Reveals. Invites discovery.
**Emotion it should evoke:** "Oh! There are people here. Real people. Let me see who they are."

This is the **simplest possible discovery feature**. Not a social feed (that's Meadow). Not themed communities (that's Forests). Not an immersive 3D walk (that's Wander). Just... a phone book. A list of everyone who wants to be found. The first rung on the discovery ladder.

## The Discovery Trilogy

```
         ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
         │                                             │
         │   [THIS]  →  See who's here (browse/find)   │
         │   Forests →  Find your community (themed)   │
         │   Meadow  →  Follow their words (social)    │
         │                                             │
         └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This feature fills the gap BEFORE Forests and Meadow exist. You can't discover communities if you can't first discover *people*. This is the foundation.

## Visualizing the Grove

Where does a directory live in this picture?

You step back from the grove. You look UP. From above, you see the **canopy** — every tree's crown, visible, distinct. Some trees have raised their branches high so you can see them. Others stay low, private, hidden beneath the taller trees.

The directory IS the canopy. Not a separate thing. Just the grove, seen from the right angle.

---

## Walking Through...

I enter the grove. I'm new. I want to know who else is here.

I could walk the paths between the trees (browse subdomains), but I don't know anyone's name. I could wait for Meadow to open (social feed), but it doesn't exist yet. I could look for a Forest (community), but those aren't built either.

What I need is simpler than all of that. I need to **look up**.

I tilt my head back. Through the gaps in the leaves, I see... crowns. Each tree's crown is unique — different shapes, different colors, some flowering, some evergreen. And some of them have little flags tied to their highest branches. Flags that say: "I'm here. This is who I am. Come visit."

Not every tree has a flag. Only the ones that WANT to be found. The rest are happy in their privacy, growing quietly.

I scan the crowns. I see one with a camera emoji on its flag — a photographer. Another with ink-stained branches — a writer. Another with rainbow leaves — unmistakable. I pick the one that calls to me and walk toward it.

**The canopy is the directory. The flags are the opt-in. The crown is what you show.**

## Candidates Explored

### Canopy ⭐ (RECOMMENDED)

The canopy is the uppermost layer of the forest — the part you see from above, from outside, from a distance. Every tree contributes to the canopy. When you look at the grove, the canopy is what you see.

- **What it means in nature:** The collective crowns of all the trees, forming the visible layer of the forest
- **Why it fits:** A directory IS the canopy — it's the visible layer of the community. You see everyone (who wants to be seen) from above.
- **The vibe:** Expansive. Open. Sunlit. You can see the whole grove at once.
- **Opt-in language:** "Rise into the Canopy" / "Show your crown"
- **The tagline:** "Canopy is where you see the whole grove."
- **Standard term:** User Directory
- **Potential issues:** Conceptual vicinity to Vista (monitoring = seeing from above) and Clearing (status = visibility). But the distinction is clear:
  - Clearing = see IF things work (system health)
  - Vista = see HOW things work (infrastructure)
  - Canopy = see WHO is here (people)

### Lantern

You light a lantern outside your tree so others can find you in the dark grove. The directory page shows all the lit lanterns.

- **What it means:** A handheld light source. Choice to illuminate.
- **Why it fits:** Strongly conveys opt-in nature. "Light your lantern" is a beautiful action.
- **The vibe:** Warm. Nighttime. Cozy. Individual choice.
- **Issues:** A lantern is an object, not a place. "Browse the Lanterns" feels like shopping. Also shares light metaphor with Lumen (AI gateway). And lanterns aren't especially forest-specific — they're more cabin/village.

### Cairn

A cairn is a stack of stones at a trail junction or summit. Each stone placed by someone who chose to say "I was here."

- **What it means:** Collective monument built by individual choice.
- **Why it fits:** Every person adds their stone. The cairn grows organically.
- **The vibe:** Humble. Collective. Trail culture.
- **Issues:** Cairns mark TRAILS, not PEOPLE. "Browse the Cairn" is awkward. Feels forced for a directory. Also shares conceptual space with Trails (personal roadmaps).

## The Decision: Canopy

**Why Canopy wins:**

1. **It IS the thing.** The canopy isn't an analogy for a directory — it literally IS what a directory is. The visible layer. The part you see from outside. The collective display.

2. **The opt-in is natural.** Not every tree reaches the canopy. Some grow low, in the understory, preferring shade. Opting in means raising your branches into the canopy where they can be seen. Opting out means staying in the understory — present but private.

3. **Categories work perfectly.** Different sections of the canopy show different types of growth. The photography section is a cluster of trees with particular foliage. The writing section is another. You're not SEGMENTED into categories — you're naturally clustered, and the viewer can choose where to look.

4. **It completes the ecosystem.** Canopy is where you see WHO is here. Forests is where you find communities. Meadow is where you follow their work. Three layers of discovery, each building on the last.

5. **Already reserved.** The name "canopy" is in the domain-blocklist's future-reserved section, specifically held for a Grove service. It was always waiting.

6. **The tagline writes itself:** *"See who's growing here."*

## The Entry

### Canopy
**The Visible Grove** · `grove.place/canopy`
**Standard:** User Directory

The canopy is what you see when you look at a forest from above. Every tree's crown is visible — distinct shapes, different colors, each one reaching toward the light in its own way. Some towers. Some spreads wide. Some flowers. From up here, you can see the whole grove at once.

Canopy is Grove's opt-in directory. When you're ready to be found, you raise into the Canopy — set your name, write a line about yourself, choose what kind of growth you represent. Others browse the Canopy to discover who's here: photographers, poets, developers, dreamers, anyone who chose to be visible. Not everyone reaches the canopy. Some prefer the understory — present, growing, but private. That's okay. The canopy is for those who want to say: *I'm here. Come visit.*

No algorithms. No ranking. Just trees, reaching up, visible to anyone who looks.

*See who's growing here.*
