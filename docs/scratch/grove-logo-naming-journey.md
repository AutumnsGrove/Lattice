# Grove Logo Design Journey

> Finding a logo that feels like coming home to the grove.

---

## The Challenge

The current Grove logo is an asterisk shape (4 arrows pointing outward + trunk), which is too similar to Linktree's trademarked logo. We need something distinctly original that still captures Grove's nature-inspired, welcoming aesthetic.

## Visualizing the Grove

```
                              ☀️
                        🌲    🌳    🌲
                     🌲   ( clearing )   🌲
                        🌲    🌳    🌲
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
                   ROOTS CONNECT BENEATH
                      (mycelium network)
```

## What IS the Grove Logo, Fundamentally?

The logo is:
- **Not a literal tree** - we already have tree components (TreePine, TreeCherry, etc.)
- **A sense of place** - Grove is "a place to Be"
- **A gathering point** - where paths converge, community forms
- **The heart** - like Heartwood, the authentic core

The logo should feel:
- **Welcoming** - like entering a cozy forest clearing
- **Organic** - natural curves, not rigid geometry
- **Alive** - could work across seasons
- **Interconnected** - paths meeting, roots joining

## Walking Through...

I enter the grove. I look around.

What do I see that represents this *place*?

- A **clearing** where light filters through the canopy
- **Three trees** standing together (not one, because community)
- **Interlocking branches** creating a canopy overhead
- **A path** that opens into a welcoming space
- **The letter G** - simple, but could be organic
- **Overlapping leaves** creating depth and shelter

## Design Directions

### Direction 1: The Clearing Ring
A circular/oval shape representing the clearing where paths meet. Negative space creates the feeling of an open, welcoming center.

**Concept:** Three curved lines forming a ring-like shape, suggesting branches arching to create a sheltered space.

### Direction 2: The Connected Canopy
Overlapping organic shapes representing three trees' canopies joining together, viewed from below looking up.

**Concept:** Three rounded, leaf-like shapes that overlap in the center, creating unity while maintaining individual identity.

### Direction 3: The Organic G
The letter G rendered with organic, branch-like qualities. Not corporate, but alive.

**Concept:** A G that feels grown, not drawn - with natural thickness variation like a living branch.

### Direction 4: The Gathering
Three abstract tree forms leaning inward, creating a sense of coming together.

**Concept:** Minimal, geometric interpretation of three trees forming a unified mark.

### Direction 5: The Mycelium Mark
Interconnected dots/nodes representing the underground network - the roots that connect all trees in the grove.

**Concept:** Abstract representation of connection itself, rather than trees.

## Tagline Tests

> "Grove is where you _______________."

- **Clearing Ring:** "Grove is where you find an open space to breathe."
- **Connected Canopy:** "Grove is where you're sheltered by community."
- **Organic G:** "Grove is where you grow."
- **The Gathering:** "Grove is where trees grow together."
- **Mycelium Mark:** "Grove is where roots connect beneath the surface."

## Walking Each Concept Through the Grove

### Concept 1: Clearing Ring
*Three organic curves forming a ring with a central dot*

**The walk:** I enter the grove and look for... what? Three disconnected curves? This doesn't feel like a *place*. It feels abstract, like a diagram.

**Verdict:** Too disconnected. The curves don't create unity. **Rejected.**

---

### Concept 2: Connected Canopy
*Three overlapping leaf/canopy shapes*

**The walk:** I look up through the trees. I see overlapping canopies creating shelter. This is community—individual trees that together create something larger.

**Issues:** At very small sizes (16x16), the overlapping shapes might blur into a blob. The trunk feels tacked on.

**Verdict:** Strong concept but execution needs refinement.

---

### Concept 3: Organic G
*A letter G that feels grown, with a leaf accent*

**The walk:** "G for Grove." Simple. Direct. The organic curves feel like a branch, not corporate typography.

**Issues:** Lettermarks can feel cold, but the organic quality and leaf accent warm it up. Very memorable.

**Verdict:** **Strong contender.** Clear, memorable, works at all sizes.

---

### Concept 4: The Gathering
*Three trees leaning inward*

**The walk:** Three trees coming together. I see the gathering place. But... this looks like many tree logos. It doesn't feel distinctly *Grove*.

**Verdict:** Too generic. Could be any forest company. **Rejected.**

---

### Concept 5: Mycelium
*Interconnected nodes and lines*

**The walk:** I understand the philosophy—roots connecting beneath the surface. But at 16x16, this becomes an unreadable mess.

**Verdict:** Conceptually beautiful, practically unusable at icon sizes. **Rejected for primary logo** (could work as secondary pattern).

---

### Concept 6: Clearing Path
*An arch/doorway shape made of two converging branches*

**The walk:** I'm walking through the forest. Ahead, two trees arch together, creating an opening. Beyond is the clearing. This is *entering* the grove.

**Issues:** Could look like a generic arch or horseshoe. The keystone dot helps ground it.

**Verdict:** **Strong contender.** Evokes invitation and threshold.

---

### Concept 7: Three Leaves
*Three leaves arranged in a gentle spiral around a center*

**The walk:** I pick up a fallen leaf. Then another. Three leaves gathered together—each unique, but part of the same tree, the same grove.

**Issues:** Very simple. Maybe *too* simple? But simplicity is strength for icons.

**Verdict:** **Strong contender.** Works at any size, organic, distinct.

---

### Concept 8: Grove Seal
*A circular ring with three internal paths meeting at center*

**The walk:** I find a waystone marker in the forest. It's a seal—showing the three paths that meet at this grove. A map, an identity, a belonging.

**Issues:** The ring gives it formality. The internal paths create meaning. Good balance.

**Verdict:** **Strong contender.** Has badge quality while staying organic.

---

## The Finalists

After walking through, four concepts stand out:

1. **The Organic G** (Concept 3) — Most memorable, ties directly to "Grove"
2. **The Clearing Path** (Concept 6) — Most welcoming, evokes entering a space
3. **Three Leaves** (Concept 7) — Simplest, most versatile
4. **Grove Seal** (Concept 8) — Best balance of formal and organic

---

## Glass Variant Considerations

All concepts work with Grove's glassmorphism pattern:
- **Glass Card** — Logo inside a frosted card container
- **Glass Tint** — Logo with translucent backdrop
- **Glass Accent** — Logo with colored glass backing
- **Glass Overlay** — White logo on dark glass for dark mode

The logo should work as a standalone mark AND inside glass containers.
