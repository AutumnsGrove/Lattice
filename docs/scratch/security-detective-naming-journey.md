# Naming Journey: Cross-Codebase Security Auditor

## What Is This Thing?

**Fundamentally:**
It's a detective. Not a guard (that's the turtle), not a surveyor (that's the hawk), not a rummager (that's the raccoon). This creature walks into unfamiliar territory — ANY codebase, ANY tech stack — and pieces together the full security story. What's there, what's missing, what's hiding.

**What does it DO?**
It investigates. It arrives at an unknown codebase, canvasses the scene by fanning out parallel investigators across every security domain simultaneously, interrogates the suspicious findings, deduces the overall security posture, and closes the case with a graded report.

**What emotion should it evoke?**
Confidence. When the Raven closes a case, you KNOW where you stand. Not fear, not anxiety — clarity. Like hiring a private investigator who gives you the full picture, no sugar-coating, but also no panic.

## Walking Through the Forest

I enter the grove at dusk. The existing security animals are here:

The **Hawk** circles above, surveying the whole grove from altitude — threat modeling, OWASP, the formal 14-domain assessment. Deep, thorough, slow. The Hawk knows this forest intimately.

The **Raccoon** rummages through the underbrush — secrets in the dirt, dead code, vulnerabilities hiding in dependencies. Gets its paws dirty. Cleans up what it finds.

The **Turtle** carries its shell — defense-in-depth, layered hardening, exotic attack vectors. Patient, methodical, permanent protection grown from within.

The **Spider** weaves the authentication web — PKCE, sessions, route protection. Specialized, precise, structural.

But there's a gap. All these animals know THIS forest. They were born here. What happens when someone brings us a _different_ forest entirely? A Python Django app. A Go microservice. A Rails monolith. A Next.js SaaS. These animals don't know those territories.

I walk past the campfire at the edge of the grove, into the dark between the trees. I need something that operates in the unknown. Something that arrives at unfamiliar places and pieces together the truth, fast. Something noir.

I see it perched on a dead branch, silhouetted against the moon. Black feathers. Sharp eyes. Patient. Intelligent — one of the smartest animals in existence. It sees patterns others miss. It remembers every face, every place, every slight.

**The Raven.**

## Candidates

**Raven** 🐦‍⬛

- Natural meaning: One of the most intelligent animals on Earth. Tool users, pattern recognizers, problem solvers. Dark-feathered, associated with mystery, the liminal space between known and unknown.
- Why it fits: Ravens are investigators by nature — they observe, remember, solve puzzles. Dark plumage screams noir detective. They're comfortable in unfamiliar territory.
- The vibe: "A dark figure arrives at a codebase it's never seen before, and within the hour, knows every secret it holds."
- Potential issues: Ravens can have "trickster" connotations. We want methodical investigator, not trickster. Framing as noir detective counters this perfectly.

**Falcon** 🦅

- Natural meaning: Fast, precise, predatory.
- Why it fits: Speed of investigation, precision of findings.
- The vibe: Too similar to Hawk. Too aggressive for what's essentially an audit.
- Potential issues: Overlaps with hawk-survey's aerial surveyor role.

**Magpie** 🐦

- Natural meaning: Collects shiny things, intelligent, social.
- Why it fits: Collecting findings, gathering evidence.
- The vibe: Too whimsical. Doesn't have the gravitas of a professional audit.
- Potential issues: "Magpie" doesn't evoke trust the way a detective should.

## The Tagline Test

"The Raven is where you go when you need the truth about a codebase you've never seen before."
"The Raven investigates what others overlook."
"Every codebase has a story. The Raven reads it in the dark."

## Selection: Raven

The Raven is the noir detective of the grove. It doesn't live in any one forest — it flies between them. When you need a professional investigator to walk into an unfamiliar codebase and tell you exactly where the bodies are buried, you call the Raven.

**Noir Detective Framing:**

- Phases use noir language: ARRIVE, CANVAS, INTERROGATE, DEDUCE, CLOSE
- Findings are "evidence," problems are "suspects," the report is "the case file"
- The Raven speaks in clipped, confident noir narration
- Think: Raymond Chandler meets OWASP Top 10

**Key Differentiator from Hawk:**

- Hawk is a DEEP assessment of a codebase you know (14 domains, STRIDE, formal)
- Raven is a RAPID cross-codebase audit of a codebase you've NEVER seen (parallel, graded, portable)
- Hawk takes hours. Raven takes minutes (via parallel sub-agents).
- Hawk produces formal security reports. Raven produces graded posture assessments.

**The Parallel Fan-Out Innovation:**
The Raven doesn't investigate sequentially. After arriving and scoping the scene, it dispatches multiple parallel sub-agents — each investigating a different security domain simultaneously. This is the "canvassing the neighborhood" phase. Six agents, running in parallel, reporting back with findings. Then the Raven synthesizes.

This makes the Raven dramatically faster than any other security skill while covering more ground.
