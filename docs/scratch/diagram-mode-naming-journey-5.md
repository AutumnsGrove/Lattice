# Diagram Mode Naming Journey 5: Reaching for the Valley

> "Reach for the valley."

---

## The Context

We're naming the **diagram sub-mode** within Weave (Grove's visual composition studio).

The animation sub-mode is already called **Breeze**.

### What Didn't Work

- **Trace** — too passive, generic, feels like following
- **Dew** — passive, delicate, beautiful but not action-like
- **Frost** — not action-like, too static
- **Ridge** — a place, not an action
- **Span** — too abstract, feels like connecting just TWO objects, not the whole vista

### The New Direction

> "Reach for the valley."

The key insight:
- REACHING - extending outward with intention
- The VALLEY below - the whole landscape spread out beneath you
- Not just connecting two points, but SEEING AND CONNECTING EVERYTHING
- The gesture of reaching out from a high place toward what's below
- Embracing the whole vista, grasping the complete picture

## Visualizing the Scene

```
                    🏔️ (you are here)
                     |
                     | reaching
                     ↓ down toward

        ╱────────────────────────╲
       ╱  🌲    🏠    💧    🌾   ╲
      ╱   connections everywhere  ╲
     ╱    the whole landscape      ╲
    ╱          the valley           ╲
   ╱_______________________________╲
```

You're standing on the mountain. The valley spreads out below. You can see EVERYTHING: the trees, the houses, the streams, the fields. And you reach out to GRASP it all, to connect it, to understand how it all fits together.

This is what diagramming is: standing back far enough to see the whole system, then reaching out to connect every part.

---

## What IS Diagramming?

Fundamentally, it's:
- **Seeing the whole** - not one component, but the entire system
- **Connecting everything** - lines between all the pieces
- **Grasping structure** - understanding how it all fits
- **Reaching across** - spanning the entire landscape of your composition

It's an expansive gesture. You're not looking at one tree, you're seeing the forest AND the meadow AND the stream AND how they all relate.

---

## The Gesture

Close your eyes. Picture this:

You climb to a high place. You look down at the valley below. The entire landscape spreads out: paths, clearings, groves, streams. Everything visible at once.

What do you do?

You **reach out** toward it. Your arms extend. Your gaze sweeps across. You're not just connecting point A to point B. You're embracing the ENTIRE vista. You're gathering it all in.

This is the gesture of diagramming.

## Walking Through Nature: The Verbs

What actions in nature capture this?

### Sweep
- A hawk sweeping across the valley
- Wind sweeping through the trees
- Your gaze sweeping the landscape
- Sweeping your hand across the vista

**Sweep** = moving across the WHOLE space, not just a line between two points

### Gather
- Gathering wildflowers from an entire meadow
- Gathering connections
- Bringing everything together
- The valley gathers water from all the mountains

**Gather** = bringing the whole landscape into your understanding

### Embrace
- Opening your arms to embrace the valley
- Embracing the complete picture
- The gesture of taking it ALL in

**Embrace** = surrounding, encompassing

### Clasp
- Clasping the landscape in your view
- Too grabby, too forceful
- Doesn't have the expansive feeling

### Fold
- The valley is a fold in the landscape
- Interesting, but feels more passive
- You don't fold a diagram, you create it

### Reach
- Reaching toward the valley
- Good but incomplete on its own
- Needs the destination

## The Strongest Candidate: SWEEP

I keep coming back to **Sweep**.

Here's why it fits:

1. **Active gesture** - sweeping is something you DO
2. **Expansive** - when you sweep, you cover the WHOLE area
3. **Visual clarity** - you can picture sweeping your hand/gaze across the landscape
4. **Not just two points** - sweeping is about the entire space
5. **Natural motion** - hawks sweep, wind sweeps, your eyes sweep
6. **Fits with Breeze** - breeze is gentle animation; sweep is purposeful connection

### Testing the Tagline

> "Sweep is where you see the whole landscape and connect every part."

> "Sweep is the gesture of reaching across the valley to grasp the complete picture."

> "Sweep across the valley. Connect everything you see."

YES. This feels right.

---

## The Full Picture

When you're in **Breeze**, you're adding gentle motion to individual elements. Animation flows like wind through leaves.

When you're in **Sweep**, you pull back to see the ENTIRE composition. You see every component, every relationship, every connection. You reach across the whole valley of your work and connect it all together.

Breeze = the wind moving through the trees
Sweep = the gesture of seeing and connecting the entire forest

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Gather
Beautiful, but feels more passive. You gather things TO you. Sweep is the active gesture OF reaching out.

### Embrace
Warm and encompassing, but perhaps too soft for the technical act of diagramming. Sweep has more precision.

### Vista
Already taken (Infrastructure Observability). Also a noun (a place/view), not a verb.

### Range
Could work ("ranging across the landscape"), but "range" feels more about distance/extent than the active gesture of connecting.

### Arc
Interesting - the arc of your gesture - but feels like a curve, a single line, not the whole landscape.

## The Decision

**Sweep**

When you enter Sweep mode in Weave, you're pulling back to see everything. You're reaching across the whole valley of your composition. You're connecting every component, understanding every relationship.

You sweep your gaze across the landscape.
You sweep your hand toward the valley below.
You sweep through the diagram, connecting it all.

Active. Expansive. Everything at once.

*This is the one.*

---

## Visual Metaphor

```
Mountain View (You):      Sweep mode = seeing this:
      🏔️
       |                   🌲──────🏠
       ↓                    │   ╱  │
                           💧─╱────🌾
   The Valley:             │      │
  🌲 🏠 💧 🌾            [ALL]  [CONNECTED]
```

Breeze makes the trees sway.
Sweep shows how everything connects.

---

## Grove Voice Check

Does this sound like Grove?

> "Sweep is where you reach across the whole valley. When you're deep in Weave, building animations and compositions, sometimes you need to pull back and see the complete picture. Sweep mode shows you every component, every relationship, every connection. Like standing on a mountain and taking in the entire landscape below, Sweep lets you grasp how everything fits together."

Yes. This feels like Grove. Natural, warm, clear about what it does.

---

## Integration with Weave

- **Weave** = the visual composition studio
- **Breeze** = animation sub-mode (gentle motion)
- **Sweep** = diagram sub-mode (seeing and connecting everything)

When you're in Weave, you can switch between modes:
- Default: building your composition
- Breeze: adding animation
- Sweep: viewing the complete structure

Perfect parallel. Both nature verbs. Both active. Both clear about what they do.

## Final Answer

**SWEEP**

The name for the diagram sub-mode within Weave.

When you need to see the whole valley and connect everything, you **Sweep**.
