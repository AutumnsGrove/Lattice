# Naming Journey: Project Quoting & Estimation Animal

## What Is This Thing?

**Fundamentally:**
It's an appraiser. It takes the Raven's case file — or any assessment of work — and translates it into a professional quote. Scope, timeline, cost, deliverables. The bridge between "here's what's wrong" and "here's what it'll cost to fix it."

**What does it DO?**
It calculates. It takes audit findings, categorizes them by complexity, estimates effort using agent-accelerated development rates, applies a 15% buffer so we never over-promise, and produces a polished proposal document ready for a client.

**What emotion should it evoke?**
Precision and trust. When a client receives this quote, they should feel: "This person knows exactly what they're doing, exactly how long it will take, and exactly what it will cost. No surprises."

## Walking Through the Forest

I enter the grove at dawn — the Raven is still settling in from last night's creation, dark feathers ruffling against the morning light.

The Raven investigates. The Raccoon cleans. The Turtle hardens. The Spider weaves auth. But none of them price the work. None of them translate technical findings into dollars and timelines. There's a gap between the case file and the contract.

I walk past the campfire toward the river. I need something that:

1. Sees the work clearly from above
2. Calculates with precision before committing
3. Accounts for hidden complexity (things look simpler than they are)
4. Commits fully and delivers with confidence

I look at the river. I see it.

Hovering above the water, wings spread wide, calculating. It sees the fish beneath the surface — but it KNOWS the fish isn't where it appears. Light bends through water. The fish is actually deeper, further than it looks. The Osprey adjusts for this distortion. It calculates the TRUE position — the true effort — before it dives.

This is why the Osprey has the highest success rate of any fishing raptor: 70-80%. It doesn't miss because it accounts for what others overlook.

The 15% buffer IS the light refraction adjustment. Scope always looks smaller from above than it actually is. The Osprey knows this.

## Candidates

**Osprey** 🦅

- Natural meaning: A fish-hunting raptor with the highest success rate of any bird of prey. Known for calculating the precise angle of dive, adjusting for light refraction in water (fish appear closer to surface than they are). Hovers before committing.
- Why it fits: The refraction metaphor IS the 15% buffer. Scope looks simpler from above than it actually is. The Osprey adjusts. It sees through the distortion to the true effort. Hover → Calculate → Dive → Deliver.
- The vibe: "This estimate accounts for everything — even what you can't see yet."
- Potential issues: Similar to hawk (both raptors). But hawk surveys security domains; osprey prices the work. Different niches entirely. Osprey is also water-focused (business/commerce metaphor — "cash flow").

**Magpie** 🐦

- Natural meaning: Intelligent corvid, collects valuable objects, assesses worth.
- Why it fits: Collecting data points, assessing value, calculating worth.
- The vibe: A bit scattered. Magpies hoard; this animal needs to PRICE, not collect.
- Potential issues: "Magpie" doesn't evoke trust. Clients want precision, not curiosity. Also corvid — too close to the Raven.

**Ant** 🐜

- Natural meaning: Precise resource calculator, plans routes, estimates loads.
- Why it fits: Meticulous planning, precise resource allocation.
- The vibe: Too small. Doesn't feel like a business partner. Feels like a worker, not an advisor.
- Potential issues: Colony metaphor doesn't fit solo estimation work.

**Woodpecker** 🪺

- Natural meaning: Taps methodically, measures depth, assesses structural integrity.
- Why it fits: "Tapping" at each finding, measuring the depth of work needed.
- The vibe: Technical but not business-savvy. Feels like another auditor, not a pricer.
- Potential issues: Overlaps with assessment role. We need the business bridge, not more assessment.

## The Tagline Test

"The Osprey is where the case file becomes a contract."
"The Osprey sees through the surface to the true cost."
"The Osprey hovers, calculates, and dives with precision."

## Selection: Osprey

The Osprey is the precision estimator of the grove. Where the Raven uncovers the truth, the Osprey prices it. The light-refraction metaphor is perfect for the 15% buffer — scope ALWAYS looks smaller from above, and the Osprey is the one bird that adjusts for this naturally.

**Key metaphor:** Water refraction = hidden complexity. The Osprey accounts for the distortion between apparent scope and real scope.

**The phases:**

```
HOVER → SIGHT → CALCULATE → DRAFT → DELIVER
```

1. HOVER — Survey the work from altitude (intake the audit/case file)
2. SIGHT — Identify and categorize all work items (adjust for refraction)
3. CALCULATE — Estimate effort, apply rates, add the 15% buffer
4. DRAFT — Write the professional proposal
5. DELIVER — Present, finalize, archive

**Business energy, not technical energy.** The Osprey speaks in terms of deliverables, milestones, investment — not vulnerabilities and patches. It translates technical into commercial.

_The Osprey hovers where air meets water — where the technical becomes commercial. It sees through the surface. It always knows the true depth._ 🦅
