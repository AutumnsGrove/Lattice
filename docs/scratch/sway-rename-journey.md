# Sway Rename Journey

*January 7, 2026 — A walk to find what Sway should become*

---

## What Are We Naming?

The **animation sub-mode** within Weave. Currently called "Sway."

What it does:
- Place nature assets on a grid (Rock, Vine, Tree, Lattice)
- Draw threads between them (connections)
- Configure timing (duration, delay, easing)
- **Motion propagates through chains**

The core experience from the spec:
> "Jiggle the rock → all vines jangle in sequence, delays cascading down the tree."

```
[Rock] (root)
   │
   ├── [Vine 1]
   │      ├── [Vine 1a]
   │      └── [Vine 1b]
   │
   ├── [Vine 2]
   │      └── [Vine 2a]
   │             └── [Vine 2aa]
   │
   └── [Vine 3]
```

Shake the rock. Watch the whole chain come alive.

## What IS This Thing?

### Fundamentally:
- It's about **motion**—things moving
- It's about **propagation**—motion spreading through connections
- It's about **chains**—parent moves, children follow
- It's about **aliveness**—a static scene waking up

### What it DOES in the user's life:
- **Animates** — brings stillness to life
- **Connects motion** — chains of movement
- **Creates rhythm** — timing, delays, easing
- **Awakens** — the scene stirs

### What emotion should it evoke?
- Aliveness
- Playfulness
- Natural rhythm
- The forest breathing

## Walking Through the Forest

I enter the grove. I see my tree—my blog.

I open Terrarium to create something for my header. A scene with vines and rocks and butterflies.

I've placed everything. It's pretty. But it's still.

I want it to *move*. I want to jiggle the rock and watch all the vines ripple in sequence. I want the butterfly to bob when its branch sways.

So I open Weave. I draw the connections—threads linking parent to child.

Now I need to see it move. I need to wake it up.

I switch to... **what**?

What happens when I do?

The scene stirs. I touch the root. Motion travels. Through threads, down chains.

```
  ~ rustle ~
     ~ rustle ~
        ~ rustle ~
```

Like wind through underbrush.
Like something stirring in the leaves.
Like the forest coming alive.

## Why "Sway" Doesn't Fit

"Sway" describes what a **single thing** does.
- A tree sways
- A vine sways
- A pendulum sways

But that's not what this mode is about.

This mode is about **connected motion**. Chains. Propagation.
Not one thing swaying—many things moving *together*, motion traveling through them.

The mode needs a name that captures **spreading movement**, not isolated swaying.

---

## Candidates

### 1. Rustle

**The sound/motion of leaves disturbed, spreading through branches**

```
grove.place/weave → Rustle mode
```

- What it means: Wind moves through underbrush, leaves shift, branches whisper
- Motion *spreads*—it's not one thing, it's many things responding
- "Rustle your scene to life"
- "The forest rustles awake"

**Tagline test:**
> "Rustle is where motion travels through your scene."

**Potential issues:**
- Slightly audio-connotative (the sound of rustling)
- But the visual aspect is just as strong

---

### 2. Stir

**The beginning of motion, something waking**

```
grove.place/weave → Stir mode
```

- What it means: A gentle awakening, the first movement
- "Stir your scene to life"
- Simple and evocative

**Tagline test:**
> "Stir is where your scene wakes up."

**Potential issues:**
- "Stir" has cooking connotations (stirring a pot)
- Less about propagation, more about initiation

---

### 3. Ripple

**Waves spreading outward from a point**

```
grove.place/weave → Ripple mode
```

- What it means: Drop a pebble, watch waves spread
- Perfect for propagation concept
- "Motion ripples through your scene"

**Tagline test:**
> "Ripple is where one movement becomes many."

**Potential issues:**
- Very water-focused
- Grove is more forest than pond

---

### 4. Quiver

**A slight trembling, like a bow string or leaves in wind**

```
grove.place/weave → Quiver mode
```

- What it means: Subtle trembling motion
- "Your scene quivers with life"
- Also: a container for arrows (branching structure)

**Tagline test:**
> "Quiver is where stillness becomes motion."

**Potential issues:**
- Double meaning (arrows) might confuse
- Slightly archaic feel

---

### 5. Shiver

**A quick, spreading tremor**

```
grove.place/weave → Shiver mode
```

- What it means: A tremor moving through something
- "A shiver runs through the scene"
- Motion that *travels*

**Tagline test:**
> "Shiver is where motion runs through your scene."

**Potential issues:**
- Cold connotation (shivering from cold)
- Less warm than other options

---

### 6. Flutter

**Light, quick movements**

```
grove.place/weave → Flutter mode
```

- What it means: Butterflies, leaves in breeze
- Light and alive
- "Your vines flutter in the wind"

**Tagline test:**
> "Flutter is where your scene takes flight."

**Potential issues:**
- Too light? The mode handles heavy chains too
- More about individual motion than propagation

---

### 7. Murmur

**Soft sounds spreading through trees**

```
grove.place/weave → Murmur mode
```

- What it means: Whispered sounds traveling
- "A murmur moves through the forest"
- Communal, spreading

**Tagline test:**
> "Murmur is where motion whispers through your scene."

**Potential issues:**
- Too audio-focused
- Less physical motion, more metaphorical

---

## The Choice: Rustle

After the walk, **Rustle** emerges as the strongest candidate.

### Why Rustle?

1. **It's about propagation** — A rustle isn't one leaf moving. It's motion spreading through connected things. Exactly what this mode does.

2. **It's a forest-floor phenomenon** — Pairs naturally with Fern (diagrams). Both are things you experience in the underbrush, at ground level.

3. **It implies aliveness** — "Something rustled in the leaves" — the forest waking up, responding.

4. **It works as verb and noun**:
   - "Open Rustle" (the mode)
   - "Rustle your composition" (the action)
   - "Watch it rustle to life" (the experience)

5. **The spec already uses the concept**:
   > "jangle jangle" → rustling motion through chains

### The Pairing

| Mode | Name | Nature Phenomenon |
|------|------|-------------------|
| Animation | **Rustle** | Motion spreading through underbrush |
| Diagrams | **Fern** | Branching, fractal structure |

Both are forest-floor sensations. Both happen in the same layer of the grove. They belong together.

## The Entry

## Rustle
**Animation Mode** · *Within Weave*

A rustle is what happens when motion moves through connected things. Wind stirs the underbrush. Branches brush against leaves. Something shifts in the ferns, and the tremor travels. It's not one thing moving—it's everything responding to everything else.

Rustle is the animation mode within Weave. Place nature assets on a grid, draw threads between them, configure timing and easing—then wake the root node and watch motion propagate through the chain. Vines jangle. Branches tremble. Butterflies bob. Everything connected, everything alive.

A single shake at the root, and the whole forest rustles.

*Wake it up. Watch it move.*
