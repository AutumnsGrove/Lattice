# Centennial: A Walk Through the Grove

*A naming journey for a concept that spans beyond one lifetime.*

---

## The Starting Point

Autumn brings me "Centennial" - 100 years. A workshop of some kind. But there's friction:

**What resonates:**
- 100 years is about how long some trees live
- There's poetry in that connection
- It feels *Grove*

**The friction from others:**
- "That's a really long time"
- "50 years is more realistic"
- "You're not gonna live 100 years - how do you even prove it's possible?"

The criticism is fair. Centennial asks people to conceptualize something beyond their own lifespan. That's... a lot.

## Step 1: Visualize the Grove

```
                                    ☀️

                    🌲      🌳      🌲      🌲
                 🌲    🌳      🌲    🌳    🌲
              🌲   [MEADOW - gathering]   🌲
                        🌿 🌿 🌿
                 🌲  🌳     🌲   🌲  🌳
                   [PANTRY]    [PORCH]
                      🏠          🪵
             🌲    🌳    🌲    🌳    🌲

    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
               MYCELIUM NETWORK BELOW
           (connections spanning the forest)
               PATINA protects over time
               RINGS record the seasons
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════

                    ?? CENTENNIAL ??
             Where does 100 years live?
```

Where are the time-related concepts already?
- **Rings** - records seasons, private growth over time
- **Patina** - "Age as armor. Time as protection."
- **Amber** - fossilized resin, "preserving moments in time"
- **Trails** - the path you're walking, marked by where you've been

Hmm. Grove already has a relationship with time. But it's usually *backward-looking*: what has accumulated, what has been preserved. Rings count backward. Patina forms over years. Amber captures what was.

---

## Step 2: What IS Centennial?

Let me sit with this question. What is a workshop about "100 years" actually *about*?

**Is it about:**
- Planning for the long term?
- Building things that outlast you?
- Legacy?
- Sustainability?
- Intergenerational thinking?
- Cathedral thinking? (starting something you won't see finished)

**The tree connection:**

A tree that lives 100 years...
- Was planted by someone who wouldn't see it fully grown
- Shelters generations who didn't plant it
- Grows slowly, deliberately
- Becomes part of the landscape others build around

**The honest critique:**
"You won't live 100 years."

True. But here's the thing - when someone plants an oak sapling, they're not planting it for themselves. They're planting it for someone they'll never meet.

That's not naive. That's *generous*.

---

## Step 3: What Does It DO?

If Centennial is a workshop, what happens there?

**Possibilities:**
- Planning tools for long-term projects?
- Framework for thinking in longer timescales?
- A place to set intentions that span beyond your own timeline?
- Legacy planning?
- Documentation of "why" that survives you?

What's the *need* this fills?

Most productivity tools optimize for the short term. Quarterly goals. Sprint planning. Next week's tasks. But some things can't be built in a quarter. Some things require you to think in generations.

**The emotion:**
Not urgency. Not efficiency.
Something slower. More... patient?

Hope, maybe. Planting seeds for fruit you won't taste.

---

## Step 4: Walking Through the Forest

*I enter the grove. I see the Meadow where others gather. I check my Rings - private seasons of growth. I walk past the Porch where we talk. I visit Pantry when I need something.*

*But today I'm thinking about something different. Not this week's post. Not this month's project. I'm thinking about... what lasts.*

*What will this blog be in 10 years? 20? Will anyone tend it when I'm gone? What am I actually building here?*

*I need a place to... think longer. To plan for time I won't see.*

*Where do I go?*

---

## The Problem with "Centennial"

Reading it back, I think I see the issue:

"Centennial" is a *number*. It's specific (100 years) but abstract. It doesn't evoke a *place* or *thing* in the forest - it evokes a measurement.

Compare to existing Grove names:
- Meadow → I can picture a meadow
- Pantry → I can picture a pantry
- Rings → I can picture tree rings
- Porch → I can picture a porch

"Centennial" → I picture... a number? A celebration? An anniversary?

It tells you HOW LONG, but not WHAT IT IS.

---

## Reframing the Question

Maybe the question isn't "where does Centennial fit?"

Maybe the question is: "What do you call the thing in a forest that's about long-term thinking?"

**Forest things that span time:**

- **Old growth** - trees that have been here forever
- **Stumps** - what remains, records of what was
- **Seeds** - what you plant for the future
- **Acorns** - specifically, the thing that becomes an oak
- **Saplings** - young trees, the next generation
- **Root systems** - what spreads underground over decades
- **Canopy** - what emerges after many years of growth
- **Anchor trees** - the biggest, oldest trees that shape the forest around them
- **Mother trees** - the ones that nurture seedlings through mycelium
- **Nurse logs** - fallen trees that become the ground for new growth

**Human-scale forest things:**

- **Foundation stones** - what you build on
- **Cairns** - stones stacked by travelers, lasting markers
- **Carvings** - initials in bark, lasting decades
- **Trails** - paths worn by generations (already used!)
- **Clearings** - spaces made long ago (already used!)

---

## Candidate Names

### 1. **Rootwork**
*The work that happens underground, over years.*

- Root systems take decades to develop
- They're invisible but essential
- "Rootwork" sounds like *foundational work*
- But... does it feel like a workshop? Or more like a process?

### 2. **Taproot**
*The deep, central root that anchors the tree.*

- Taproots go straight down, seeking water and stability
- They're about depth, not spread
- "Building your taproot" could mean building your foundation
- But it might be too abstract?

### 3. **Seedbed**
*(Wait - that's already used for Plant!)*

### 4. **Nursery**
*Where young trees are tended before planting.*

- A nursery is explicitly about *future* growth
- You nurture things that aren't ready yet
- There's care, patience, long-term thinking
- BUT: associations with babies, might feel off

### 5. **Orchard**
*Trees planted in rows, tended across generations.*

- Orchards take 5-20 years before they fruit
- They're explicitly intergenerational
- "The Orchard workshop" - where you plan what you're planting
- Has warmth - orchards feel cared for, not wild
- But is it too *cultivated*? Grove has a wilder feel.

### 6. **Grove Elder** / **Elder**
*The oldest trees, the ones that have seen the most.*

- Elder suggests wisdom, long view
- "Elder planning" - planning like you've been here forever
- But "Elder" as a name feels like a person, not a place/tool

### 7. **Succession**
*What happens after. The next generation of forest.*

- Ecological succession - how forests evolve over time
- "Succession planning" is already a term (business)
- Could feel too corporate?

### 8. **Horizon**
*As far as you can see, and beyond.*

- Horizons are about vision, long sight
- "Horizon planning" - planning for what you can barely see
- But is it nature enough? Horizons aren't specifically forest.

### 9. **Canopy**
*What emerges after decades of growth.*

- The canopy is the crowning achievement of the forest
- Takes generations to develop fully
- "Canopy thinking" - thinking at the level above the trees
- Could work. Has the long-term feeling.

### 10. **Acorn**
*What becomes an oak, given a hundred years.*

- An acorn is PURE potential
- Small, unassuming, but contains everything
- "The Acorn workshop" - where you plant what becomes an oak
- Directly addresses the 100-year tree lifespan!
- ...but might feel too small? Too cute?

---

## Sitting with "Acorn"

Actually, let me think about this more.

The criticism of "Centennial" was: 100 years is too long to conceptualize. You won't live that long.

But an **acorn** reframes the whole thing:

> "You're not planting a 100-year plan. You're planting an acorn."

Nobody looks at an acorn and says "that's unrealistic." They just know: if you plant it, tend it, something bigger than you will grow.

The acorn doesn't ask you to conceptualize 100 years. It asks you to plant something small, with faith.

**Testing the tagline:**
> "Acorn is where you plant what will outlast you."
> "Acorn is the workshop for long-term thinking."
> "Plant an acorn. Trust the oak."

Hmm. There's something here.

## Or: What About Keeping Centennial?

Let me steelman keeping the name as-is.

**Arguments for Centennial:**
- It's honest and direct
- 100 years is the goal - why hide it?
- Some people WILL get the tree connection
- "Centennial planning" sounds grand, important

**But the friction remains:**
- People get stuck on the number
- It's hard to conceptualize
- Feels like a measurement, not a thing

**Could we recontextualize it?**
- "Centennial Grove" - like a grove of trees that will be here in 100 years?
- "Centennial thinking" - a mode of thought, not a promise?

---

## The Real Question

Actually, I think I need to ask:

**What IS this workshop?**

Because the name depends on what it actually does. Is it:

1. **A planning tool** - helping people create long-term plans for their blogs/projects?
2. **A philosophy/framework** - teaching people to think in longer timescales?
3. **A legacy feature** - helping people decide what happens to their work after they're gone?
4. **Something else entirely?**

The right name follows the right understanding.

## Pausing Here

I've walked through the grove. I've explored candidates. But I think I need to understand more about what this workshop actually *is* before I can find where it belongs.

**Current thoughts:**
- "Centennial" has poetry but friction
- "Acorn" reframes the concept beautifully (small action → big result)
- "Canopy" has the long-term feeling but might be too abstract
- "Orchard" has warmth but might be too cultivated

**Questions to answer:**
1. What does this workshop actually DO?
2. Is it a tool, a place, a framework, or a philosophy?
3. Who is it for? (New users? Established bloggers? Everyone?)
4. What should someone FEEL when they use it?

*The path becomes clear by walking it. But sometimes you need to know where you're headed.*

*Journey status: Exploring. Waiting for more context about the workshop itself.*
