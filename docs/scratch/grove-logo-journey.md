# Grove Logo Journey: Icon Composition Walk

> A walk through the grove to find logo concepts using Lucide/Tabler icons as building blocks.

---

## The Constraint

**THE RULE: Use Lucide/Tabler icons as the primary building blocks. Minimal custom SVG.**

Not hand-drawn trees. Composed existing icons. Think of it like arranging icon "stamps" into a scene.

---

## What's Working (Bookmarked)

These existing concepts resonate:

- **First Snow** - BOOKMARKED, user LOVES it
  - Trees with snow on branches, snowflakes falling
  - Evokes: "The grove shelters, always"

- **The Hearth** - amazing
  - Trees gathered around a warm fire
  - Evokes: Community, warmth, "gather 'round"

- **Fireflies** - AMAZING
  - Trees with floating lights among them
  - Evokes: Magic, wonder, "the grove comes alive at night"

- **Night Grove** - amazing concept, moon needs work
  - Trees with moon and stars above
  - Evokes: Peace, quiet moments, "the grove at rest"

- **Fairy Ring** - great concept, needs to use actual icons more
  - Trees encircling a ring of glowing mushrooms
  - Evokes: "Magic gathers here"

---

## What Needs Improvement

- Trees are too basic/custom - should use actual Lucide TreePine, TreeDeciduous icons
- Birdhouse has potential but needs refinement
- Nest and Swing are just okay

Where do things naturally fit?

- **Above the trees**: Moon, Stars, Sparkles, Sun
- **Among the trees**: Birds, Fireflies (Sparkles), Hearts
- **At tree level**: Flame (campfire), Home (birdhouse/shelter)
- **At ground level**: Sprout, Leaf, Clover, Shrub

## Walking Through...

I enter the grove. I see...

Two pines standing together, their branches almost touching.
Above them, the moon hangs low, stars scattered across the sky.

I walk deeper. Fireflies begin to appear - little sparks of light
drifting between the trunks. Not random dots - Sparkles icons,
placed with intention.

I find a clearing. In the center, a small fire burns.
The Flame icon, warm and dancing. Trees lean in around it,
like friends gathering close on a cold night.

I look up. A bird perches on a branch.
Not just decoration - it belongs here. This is its home.

What if the logo IS this walk? Not one scene, but the feeling
of discovering something that was always there?

## Icon Composition Concepts

### Concept 1: "Starlight Pines"
**Icons:** 2x TreePine + 3x Star + Moon
**Arrangement:** Two pine trees at angles, converging slightly. Moon in upper corner. Stars scattered between/above trees.
**Custom SVG:** Just positioning. Maybe a subtle ground line.
**Feeling:** The grove at night. Peaceful. Looking up.
**Tagline:** "Find your place under the stars"

### Concept 2: "The Gathering"
**Icons:** TreePine + TreeDeciduous + Flame + Heart
**Arrangement:** Pine on left, deciduous on right, slightly angled toward each other. Flame at center-bottom between them. Small Heart floating above the flame.
**Custom SVG:** Ground line, maybe subtle warmth glow (circle) behind flame.
**Feeling:** Community. Different trees, same fire. Love in the gathering.
**Tagline:** "Different roots, shared warmth"

### Concept 3: "Firefly Forest"
**Icons:** TreePine + TreeDeciduous + 4-5x Sparkles
**Arrangement:** One tree on each side. Sparkles scattered organically in the space between.
**Custom SVG:** Just positioning. Maybe very subtle connecting dots.
**Feeling:** Magic happens here. The grove alive at night.
**Tagline:** "Where magic gathers"

### Concept 4: "Bird's Home"
**Icons:** TreePine + Bird + Heart
**Arrangement:** Single pine tree. Bird perched on a branch (positioned on tree). Heart near the bird OR as a small element in the tree's "foliage."
**Custom SVG:** A simple horizontal line for the branch the bird sits on.
**Feeling:** Finding your home. Safety. Belonging.
**Tagline:** "Your corner of the forest"

### Concept 5: "Seeds of Community"
**Icons:** Sprout + Sprout + Sprout (or Sprout + Leaf + Clover)
**Arrangement:** Three small growth icons in a row, perhaps with a gentle arc below suggesting soil/ground.
**Custom SVG:** A curved line suggesting earth, perhaps small connection lines between them (roots).
**Feeling:** Growth. Beginning. Things starting to bloom together.
**Tagline:** "Growing together"

### Concept 6: "Shelter"
**Icons:** TreePine + TreePine + Moon
**Arrangement:** Two pines creating an archway effect (angled inward), moon visible in the gap between them at top.
**Custom SVG:** None - pure icon composition.
**Feeling:** Protection. The grove as shelter. Looking through trees at the sky.
**Tagline:** "Shelter in the grove"

### Concept 7: "Heart of the Forest"
**Icons:** TreePine + TreeDeciduous + Heart (large, center)
**Arrangement:** Trees on either side, leaning slightly in. Large heart in the center between them.
**Custom SVG:** None.
**Feeling:** Love at the center of community. Heart of the grove.
**Tagline:** "Community at heart"

### Concept 8: "Winter Welcome"
**Icons:** TreePine + Snowflake + Snowflake + Snowflake
**Arrangement:** Pine tree with snowflakes falling around/on it.
**Custom SVG:** Perhaps small accent lines for snow on branches (minimal).
**Feeling:** The grove in winter. Still welcoming. Still alive.
**Tagline:** "The grove shelters, always"

## Top 5 Selections

After walking through, these feel most *Grove*:

1. **Firefly Forest** - Magic, wonder, uses Sparkles beautifully
2. **The Gathering** - Community, warmth, heart + flame
3. **Starlight Pines** - Peace, night, moon + stars above trees
4. **Shelter** - Two pines creating an archway, moon between
5. **Bird's Home** - Finding your place, single tree + bird

---

## Notes for Implementation

Each concept should:
- Use actual Lucide icon components imported and positioned
- Scale icons appropriately (TreePine might be 18-20px, Sparkles 4-6px)
- Use a shared viewBox (probably 32x32 or 24x24)
- Apply the same color/stroke props as existing logos
- Keep custom SVG to absolute minimum (positioning transforms only)

The existing logos use hand-drawn triangle trees. The new approach should import actual Lucide TreePine paths and compose them.
