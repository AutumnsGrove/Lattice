# Naming Journey: Critical Reasoning Animal

## What Is This Thing?

**Fundamentally:**
A thinker. A challenger. The creature that sits across from you and asks the questions you've been avoiding. Not a builder, not a scout, not a guard. This animal exists in the space between "I've decided" and "I've decided wisely." It's the friend who loves you enough to disagree with you.

**What does it DO?**
It challenges assumptions. It steelmans your position before finding its weakest points. It asks the questions that make you uncomfortable, not to hurt you, but because the answer matters. It picks apart plans, designs, and decisions with the precision of a puzzle-solver who genuinely wants to see you succeed.

**What emotion should it evoke?**
Respect. Intellectual rigor. The particular clarity that comes after someone pushes back on your idea and you realize your idea is stronger for it. Not fear, not defensiveness. The feeling of sitting across from a sharp friend at midnight, tea going cold, having the conversation you needed to have.

## Walking Through the Forest

I enter the grove on a gray afternoon. The canopy is thick. I pass the animals I know:

The **Eagle** soars overhead, designing architecture from 10,000 feet. It sees the shape of systems, draws boundaries, creates blueprints. But the Eagle builds. It doesn't question whether the building should happen at all.

The **Swan** glides across still water, crafting elegant specifications. Beautiful documents, precise and poetic. But the Swan takes the premise as given. It refines the shape of a decision already made.

The **Elephant** moves through the forest methodically, building multi-file features with patience. Reliable, thorough. But the Elephant executes a plan. It doesn't ask whether the plan is sound.

The **Beaver** builds tests, dam after dam, verifying that code does what it claims. But the Beaver tests implementation, not intent.

There's a gap here. Everyone is building. Everyone is creating. Nobody is asking: "But should we? And if so, is this the right way? And what are we not seeing?"

I look up. On the highest branch of a dead oak, silhouetted against the overcast sky, something is watching. Black feathers. Head tilted. Eyes that see too much.

It's been watching the whole time.

**The Crow.**

## Candidates

**Crow** (crow-reason)

- Natural meaning: One of the most intelligent animals on Earth. Crows use tools, solve multi-step puzzles, remember faces for years, hold grudges, and teach their young about danger. They're social, communicative, and deeply observant.
- Why it fits: Crows are the ultimate critical thinkers of the animal kingdom. They don't just react. They observe, plan, test, and adapt. A crow will drop a nut on a crosswalk so cars crack it open, then wait for the light to change before retrieving it. That's not instinct. That's reasoning.
- The vibe: "The one who perches above and sees what you missed. Not mean. Just honest."
- Potential issues: Crows have a reputation as ominous or pests. But that's a human projection. Crows are deeply social, playful, and loyal. The "ominous" angle actually works here: the truth sometimes feels ominous before it feels freeing.

**Raven** (already taken)

- Already used for `raven-investigate` (cross-codebase security detective). Different bird, different role. The Raven investigates security posture. The Crow reasons about decisions.

**Magpie**

- Natural meaning: Collector of shiny things. Intelligent, social.
- Why it doesn't fit: Magpies collect. The critical reasoner doesn't collect anything. It takes apart. It challenges. A magpie's reputation for hoarding shiny objects undermines the gravitas this skill needs.

**Jay**

- Natural meaning: Loud, territorial, clever.
- Why it doesn't fit: Jays are noisy and aggressive. This skill needs the quiet confidence of someone who thinks before speaking. A jay screams warnings. The Crow tilts its head and asks a question that unravels your certainty.

**Owl** (already taken)

- Already used for `owl-archive` (documentation). The Owl preserves knowledge. The Crow questions it.

## The Tagline Test

"The Crow is where you go when you need someone to tell you what you don't want to hear."

"The Crow perches on the highest branch and sees what you missed."

"Every plan has a crack. The Crow finds it before the storm does."

## Selection: Crow

The Crow is the critical thinker of the grove. It doesn't build, doesn't investigate security, doesn't write specs. It sits with you and your ideas, and it pushes. It steelmans first, because the Crow doesn't attack weak versions of arguments. It finds the strongest possible version of your position and then shows you where that strongest version still has cracks.

**Key differentiator from other animals:**

- Eagle designs architecture. Crow questions whether the architecture is right.
- Swan writes specs. Crow challenges the assumptions in those specs.
- Raven investigates security posture. Crow reasons about decisions and approaches.
- Beaver tests code. Crow tests thinking.

**The Reasoning Modes:**
The Crow doesn't have one approach. It tilts its head and selects the right angle:
- Socratic questioning for exposing contradictions
- Dialectic reasoning for thesis/antithesis/synthesis
- Pre-mortem analysis for assuming failure and working backward
- Red teaming for actively trying to break things
- Evidence audit for examining the quality of the evidence itself

**The Three-Round Rule:**
After three rounds of back-and-forth without resolution, the Crow stops circling and lands. It surfaces the core disagreement explicitly: "Here is the fundamental thing we disagree about." No more dancing around it.

**The Steelman-First Principle:**
The Crow never attacks a position it hasn't first understood and represented at its strongest. This isn't politeness. It's rigor. If you can't articulate the strongest version of what you're challenging, you don't understand it well enough to challenge it.

_The Crow has been watching since you arrived. It already knows what you're afraid to ask._
