# Diagram Mode Naming Journey 7

**Date:** January 8, 2026
**Context:** Naming the diagram sub-mode within Weave
**Companion mode:** Breeze (animation)

---

## The Problem

Six walks. Six misses.
- Reach → too abstract, about distance
- Sweep → gestural, not about understanding
- Span → vistas and mountains
- Ridge → elevation, not connection
- Frost → delicate patterns, but no action

The user said:
> "Consider what we are DOING. Diagramming. We are making diagrams, at the end of the day. One point, connected to another to help someone understand something."

**RESET. What IS diagramming?**

Not abstract. Not poetic. Not about vistas or gestures.

Diagramming is:
- Making connections visible
- Drawing lines between points
- Showing structure
- Helping someone UNDERSTAND
- Making the invisible make SENSE

## Visualizing the Grove

```
                    🌲 WEAVE 🌲
            (Visual Composition Studio)
                        |
            ____________|____________
           |                         |
        BREEZE                      ???
      (animates)                 (diagrams)

     movement                    structure
     flow                        connection
     gentle motion              clarity
```

What we're doing:
- BREEZE makes things move (wind through leaves)
- ??? makes things connect (showing the structure)

## What IS This Thing?

**Fundamentally:** It's the act of diagramming. Making a diagram. Connecting points to show relationships.

**What does it DO?**
- Shows structure
- Reveals connections
- Makes relationships clear
- Helps you understand

**What's the VERB of diagramming?**
- Chart (you chart relationships)
- Map (you map connections)
- Trace (you trace the path)
- Plot (you plot points)
- Link (you link ideas)
- Graph (you graph connections)

**What emotion?**
- Clarity
- Understanding
- "Aha!" moment
- Simplicity

## Walking Through the Forest

I'm in Weave, Grove's visual composition studio.

I have two tools:

**Breeze mode:** I watch elements move. The wind blows through. Things animate. Motion and flow.

**Diagram mode:** I need to show how things connect. I have points A, B, C. I need to draw the lines. I need to show the structure. I need to make someone UNDERSTAND.

What am I doing?

I'm... **tracing** the connections.
I'm... **mapping** the relationships.
I'm... **charting** the structure.

Wait.

**TRACE.**

---

## The Click: Trace

In nature, what do you trace?
- You **trace** a stream to its source
- You **trace** animal tracks through the forest
- You **trace** the veins in a leaf to understand its structure
- You **trace** the grain in wood to see how it grew
- You **trace** the path of roots beneath the soil

Tracing is:
- Following connections
- Making the path visible
- Understanding relationships
- Simple, direct, grounded
- About CLARITY

When you trace something, you're revealing structure that was already there.

```
    🍃 Leaf Structure 🍃

         ╱─┐
        ╱  │ ← You trace these veins
       ╱───┤    to understand the leaf
      │    │
      │  ╱─┘
      │ ╱
      │╱

  The veins were always there.
  Tracing makes them visible.
  That's what a diagram does.
```

## Candidates

### 1. Trace
**What it means:** Following the path, revealing structure, showing connections

**Why it fits:**
- You trace connections in a diagram
- You trace relationships to understand them
- You trace the structure to make it visible
- Simple, direct, grounded

**The pairing:**
- **Breeze** animates (wind moving through)
- **Trace** diagrams (following the path)

**Vibe:** Clarity, understanding, revelation, simplicity

**Issues:** None. This feels right.

### 2. Vein
**What it means:** The structure within a leaf that shows connections

**Why it fits:**
- Veins show how everything connects
- They're the diagram OF a leaf
- Visual structure

**Issues:** Too anatomical? Might feel medical rather than natural.

### 3. Branch
**What it means:** How trees show structure and connection

**Why it fits:**
- Branches show hierarchy
- They connect trunk to leaves
- Visual structure

**Issues:** "Branching" in programming has a different meaning. Might be confusing.

### 4. Path
**What it means:** The route between points

**Why it fits:**
- Simple
- Shows connection
- Direct

**Issues:** We already have "Trails" for roadmaps. Too similar.

### 5. Line
**What it means:** The connection between two points

**Why it fits:**
- Literal: diagrams are lines and points
- Simple and direct

**Issues:** Too technical, not nature-y enough for Grove

## The Winner: Trace

**Breeze** animates.
**Trace** diagrams.

One moves. One reveals.

Wind through leaves. Veins in the leaf.

## Testing the Tagline

> "Trace is where you map connections."

> "Trace reveals the structure."

> "Trace is the path made visible."

**The one:**
> "Trace the connections. Make them clear."

## The Entry

**Trace**
**Map the connections** · Weave diagram sub-mode

In the forest, you trace tracks to find where an animal went. You trace a stream to find its source. You trace the veins in a leaf to understand how it grows. Tracing reveals structure that was already there, making the invisible visible, the unclear clear.

In Weave, Trace is where you diagram. Connect one point to another. Show relationships. Map structure. Make someone understand. No fancy gestures, no abstract vistas. Just simple, clear connections that help things make sense.

*Follow the path. Reveal the structure.*

---

## Why This Works

1. **Simple and grounded:** Tracing is a real action you do in nature
2. **About clarity:** Tracing reveals structure and understanding
3. **Pairs with Breeze:** One animates (movement), one diagrams (structure)
4. **Direct:** Not abstract or poetic for the sake of it
5. **Natural fit:** Feels like it was always there

The previous names were reaching for vistas and mountains and abstract concepts.

**Trace** is just... tracing. Following the line. Making it clear.

That's what diagramming IS.
