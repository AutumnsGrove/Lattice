# User Naming Journey

> What do we call the people who call the Grove home?

---

## The Problem

Right now we have:
- Users = Trees (established metaphor)
- But "trees" doesn't work as something you call people
- "Members" feels corporate, subscription-y, cold
- "Grovers" sounds like Sesame Street
- "Residents" lacks the nature connection

We need:
1. **Individual name** - What do you call ONE person?
2. **Collective name** - What do you call ALL of them together?
3. **Action/belonging language** - When someone subscribes, what happens? What ARE they now?

## Visualizing the Grove

```
                              ☀️
                    🌲   🌲   🌲   🌲   🌲
                 🌲    🌳    🌲    🌳    🌲
              🌲   [MEADOW opens here]   🌲
           🌲    where they gather    🌲
        🌲         and connect          🌲
     🌲                                    🌲
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
              ROOTS CONNECT BENEATH
                (mycelium network)

  Each tree is a person.
  Each blog is their canopy, their foliage.
  Their roots connect through Mycelium.
  They gather in the Meadow.
  They're sheltered by Shade.
```

## What IS a User in Grove?

Not a customer. Not a subscriber. Not a member.

They're someone who **planted themselves here**.
They chose to put down roots.
They're growing in community with others.

**What they ARE:**
- A tree among trees
- Someone who planted
- Someone who's growing
- Someone rooted here

**What they DO:**
- They grow (write, create)
- They reach (connect with others)
- They shelter (provide value to readers)
- They root (commit to this place)

---

## Walking Through the Forest

I enter the grove. I see other trees—other writers, other voices.
I planted my tree here. Now I'm part of this place.
When I look around at everyone else who's here...

What do I call us?

Not a "userbase" or "community members."
We're all trees in the same grove.
We're all **rooted** here.
We're all **growing** together.

Maybe the name isn't about what we ARE (trees)
but about what we SHARE (roots, soil, this place).

---

## Candidate Directions

### Direction 1: The Rooted Ones
Focus on putting down roots, commitment to place.

- **Rooted** - "The Rooted" as collective, "I'm rooted at Grove"
- **Roots** - "Fellow roots" - but sounds weird
- **Planted** - "The Planted" - too past-tense?

### Direction 2: Growth & Living
Focus on being alive, growing.

- **Saplings** - New users are saplings, established ones are... what?
- **Growers** - "We're all growers here"
- **Growing** - "The Growing" (feels incomplete)

### Direction 3: Forest Community Words
Real terms for tree communities.

- **Stand** - A group of trees. "The Stand" for collective?
- **Grove** - Already used for the place itself
- **Canopy** - "Under the canopy" for everyone together?

### Direction 4: What Trees Do Together
How trees interact.

- **Interlaced** - Roots interlock, branches interweave
- **Kindred** - Trees of the same kind, related
- **Kin** - Simple, warm, familial

### Direction 5: Seasonal/Cyclical
Trees are defined by seasons.

- **Perennials** - We come back, we endure
- **Evergreens** - We stay, we persist
- **Deciduous** - No, this means we lose our leaves...

### Direction 6: The Forest Floor
What grows beneath and between.

- **Understory** - The smaller plants beneath the canopy
- **Groundcover** - Feels too small
- **Undergrowth** - Negative connotation

### Direction 7: Shelter & Home
Trees as homes, as places of safety.

- **Dwellers** - "Grove dwellers"
- **Denizens** - "Denizens of the grove" - too formal?
- **Keepers** - "Grovekeepers" - but that's more like admins

---

## Testing the Candidates

### "The Rooted"
> "Welcome, you're now rooted in the Grove."
> "Join 10,000 rooted writers."
> "A community of the rooted."

Feeling: Strong. Implies commitment, permanence, connection.
But: "Rooted" can mean "stuck" or "immobile."

### "Kindred"
> "Welcome, kindred."
> "10,000 kindred writers."
> "Find your kindred in the Grove."

Feeling: Warm, familial, suggests shared nature.
But: Doesn't have the tree/nature connection directly.

### "The Stand"
> "Welcome to the Stand."
> "Join the Stand."
> "You're part of the Stand now."

Feeling: Unified, strong, directly about trees.
But: Could sound militaristic. "Take a stand."

### "Evergreens"
> "Welcome, Evergreen."
> "10,000 Evergreens and growing."
> "You're an Evergreen now."

Feeling: Beautiful! Implies persistence, always present, enduring.
But: Already an existing tier name? Check this.

### "Kin"
> "Welcome, kin."
> "Grove kin."
> "You're kin now."

Feeling: Simple, warm, familial. Very natural.
But: Doesn't have tree connection explicitly.

### "Canopy"
> "Welcome to the Canopy."
> "You're under the Canopy now."
> "The Canopy grows."

Feeling: Collective, sheltering, overhead protection.
Individual: What's one person in a canopy? A leaf? A branch?

---

## New Direction: What About the ACT of Joining?

When you subscribe, you're not just becoming something.
You're DOING something. You're **taking root**.

The moment of joining = **Taking Root**
The state of being here = **Rooted**
The collective = **The Rooted**

Or...

When you join, you're **planted**.
The community = **The Planted**? No, too passive.

When you join, you **put down roots**.
You become **rooted**.
Together, you're **the grove** itself.

Wait. What if it's simpler?

---

## The Simplest Answer

**The grove IS its trees.**
**The users ARE the grove.**

- Individual: "You're a tree in the grove" (metaphor, not title)
- Collective: **The Grove** - "Welcome to the Grove" is welcome to the community
- Action: "You've taken root" / "You're rooted now"

But we need a WORD for the people, not just the metaphor...

---

## More Candidates from Tree Biology

- **Cambium** - The living layer that makes trees grow (too obscure)
- **Heartwood** - Already taken for auth
- **Sapwood** - The living outer layer (interesting...)
- **Bark** - Protective outer layer (too rough sounding)
- **Crown** - The top of the tree, the foliage (individual focused)

### What about SEEDS?

Before you're a tree, you're a seed.
A new user is a **seed** that's been planted.
They grow into their tree.
Seeds become saplings become trees.

But calling established users "trees" still doesn't work as a title.

---

## What if we DON'T need a noun?

Some communities don't have a special noun for members.

Instead, they have:
- A verb for joining
- A state of belonging
- Language that implies without naming

Examples:
- "I blog at Grove" (action)
- "I'm rooted here" (state)
- "I planted my space" (past action)
- "Fellow grovekeeper" (role, but too admin-y)

---

## The Keeper Direction

"Keeper" appears in the lore already. Autumn is "the grove keeper."

What if users are also keepers? Of their own small piece?

- **Keeper** - You keep your tree, your space
- **Groundskeeper** - Too much like a janitor
- **Treekeeper** - Awkward
- **Groveling** - NO (this means something else entirely 😅)

Wait... what about just owning the tree metaphor more directly?

---

## Leaning into "Trees"

What if it's not a title but an embrace?

"At Grove, every writer is a tree. You put down roots. You grow.
Your words are your leaves. Your readers find shelter in your shade.
Together, we're not members. We're a forest."

Collective = **The Forest**? But the place is "the Grove"...

Hmm. Let me try:

"You're not a member. You're a **tree among trees**."

---

## The Forest Floor Revisited

What if users aren't trees at all—they're what LIVES in the grove?

Trees are the blogs/spaces.
Users are the creatures/spirits that tend them.

- **Sprites** - Forest sprites, nature spirits
- **Keepers** - Those who keep/tend
- **Dwellers** - Those who dwell here
- **Denizens** - Those who belong to this place

"Welcome, fellow denizen."
"A community of 10,000 forest dwellers."
"You're a sprite of the grove now."

Does this work? It separates user from blog, which might be good?

---

## Actually... What About "Seedling"?

Small, new, full of potential. Everyone starts as a seedling.
As you grow, you become more established.
But you never stop being part of the seedling generation?

No, this breaks down. Established users aren't seedlings.

What about:

- New users = **Seedlings**
- Growing users = **Saplings** (early growth)
- Established = **Oaks** (but this is a tier name too?)

Let me check the tier structure...

---

## Tier Names (Need to Verify)

I think the tiers are tree types:
- Seedling (free?)
- Sapling (starter tier?)
- Oak (mid tier?)
- Evergreen (top tier?)

If tiers are tree types, then we can't use those as user names generally.
But we CAN use the state of being:

"You're a Sapling-tier member" vs "You're a sapling"

Maybe the tiers handle the noun and we just need good COLLECTIVE language.

---

## Current Best Candidates

### Individual (what you call ONE person):
1. **"A tree in the grove"** (metaphor, not title)
2. **"Keeper"** (one who tends their space)
3. **"Denizen"** (one who belongs here)

### Collective (what you call EVERYONE):
1. **"The Rooted"** - implies commitment, connection
2. **"The Grove"** - the people ARE the place
3. **"The Canopy"** - everyone together overhead
4. **"Kindred"** - familial, warm, related

### Action Language:
1. **"Take root"** - the act of joining
2. **"Plant yourself"** - the act of committing
3. **"Grow with us"** - ongoing belonging

---

## Testing Combinations

**Keeper + The Rooted + Take root:**
> "Welcome, Keeper. You've taken root in the Grove."
> "10,000 keepers, all rooted together."
> "You're rooted now. You're one of us."

**Denizen + The Grove + Plant yourself:**
> "Welcome, fellow denizen."
> "When you planted yourself here, you became part of the Grove."
> "We're all denizens, growing together."

**No individual noun + The Rooted + Take root:**
> "Welcome to the Grove. You've taken root."
> "The Rooted: 10,000 writers and growing."
> "Once rooted, always rooted."

---

## WAIT. New thought.

What if subscribers have a different name than free users?

- Free tier: **Visitors** (they're walking through)
- Paid tier: **Rooted** (they've committed, put down roots)

"Visitors are welcome. The Rooted stay."

This creates a natural progression:
1. You visit the Grove (browsing, reading)
2. You plant a seed (create free account)
3. You take root (subscribe, commit)

---

## The Journey Frame

| Stage | What You Are | What You Did |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Anonymous | Wanderer | Passing through |
| Free account | Visitor | Planted a seed |
| Paid subscriber | Rooted | Took root |
| Long-time active | Elder? Ancient? | Grew deep |

---

## Elder Trees?

For long-time, established, respected community members:
- **Elders** - Old trees that guide the forest
- **Ancients** - Very old, revered trees
- **Old Growth** - Preserved, valuable, protected

"The Elders of the Grove remember when..."

---

## I Think I'm Circling Something

**The answer might be "Rooted":**

- Simple, clear, nature-connected
- Implies commitment without being heavy
- Works as both state and identity
- Natural opposite: visitors (not rooted yet)
- Verb form: "take root"

**For collective:** "The Rooted"
**For action:** "You've taken root" / "Welcome among the Rooted"
**For longtime users:** "Deep-rooted" or "Elder"

Let me test this one more time:

> "Welcome to the Grove. Today, you take root."
> "Join 10,000 rooted writers."
> "The Rooted share soil. Our roots intertwine."
> "Once rooted, always rooted."

...That feels RIGHT.

---

## Alternative I Keep Coming Back To

**Kindred** is beautiful:
> "Welcome, kindred."
> "You're kindred now."
> "We're all kindred here."

It's warm, familial, suggests shared nature without being tree-specific.
Trees of the same species ARE kindred.
It works as both individual ("welcome, kindred") and collective ("the kindred").

---

## Final Candidates to Present

1. **Rooted / The Rooted**
   - Clear nature metaphor
   - Implies commitment, permanence
   - "Take root" as the action
   - Progression: Visitor → Rooted → Deep-rooted/Elder

2. **Kindred**
   - Warm, familial, inclusive
   - Works singular and plural
   - "You're kindred now"
   - Less tree-specific, more feeling-specific

3. **Keeper(s)**
   - You keep your space, tend your tree
   - Active, responsible, caring
   - "Fellow keeper"
   - Downside: might be confused with admin/staff role

4. **The Canopy** (collective only)
   - Beautiful image of everyone's leaves together
   - "Under the canopy" for belonging
   - But no clear singular form

5. **Grove-dweller** (or just the metaphor)
   - Embrace the tree metaphor fully
   - "You're a tree among trees"
   - Not a title, just language

---

## Questions for Autumn

1. Should free users have a different name than paid users?
2. Should there be progression language (visitor → rooted → elder)?
3. Is the word used casually ("hey fellow rooted!") or just in formal contexts?
4. Does it need to work on merchandise? ("I'm rooted" on a mug?)
5. How does it interact with tier names (Seedling, Oak, Evergreen)?

# Second Walk: The Wanderer Question

*After PR feedback and more reflection*

## The Tension

There are two energies pulling at this naming:

**ROOTED energy:**
- Commitment, permanence
- "I belong here"
- Putting down roots
- Connection through soil
- Staying

**WANDERER energy:**
- Movement, discovery
- "I'm exploring"
- Walking the paths
- Finding new things
- Going

These feel like opposites. But are they?

## Tier Names Are Settled

Confirmed from TODOS.md:
- Seedling ($8) → Sapling ($12) → Oak ($25) → Evergreen ($35)

These are SUBSCRIPTION TIERS, not identity names. They describe your level.
The user identity is separate—what you ARE, not what you pay.

A Seedling-tier user is still a [____].
An Evergreen-tier user is still a [____].

## What If Both Are True?

```
                     🌲 YOUR TREE 🌲
                    (your blog, your home)
                           |
                           |
    ═══════════════════════════════════════
             You're ROOTED here.
         But you still WANDER the grove.
    ═══════════════════════════════════════

Your tree is where you sleep.
But you're not a tree—you're the one who tends it.
And when you're not tending, you're walking.
Visiting other trees. Finding clearings.
Gathering in the Meadow.
```

Maybe the answer is:
- **Identity** = Wanderer (what you ARE, how you move)
- **State** = Rooted (you've planted, you have a home)
- **Activity** = Wandering (what you do in the grove)

"You're a Wanderer who's taken root."

## Testing WANDERER

> "Welcome, Wanderer."
> "Wanderers of the Grove."
> "10,000 wanderers, each with their own tree."
> "We wander. We plant. We grow."

Feeling: Free, exploratory, romantic, journey-focused.
Implication: The grove is vast. There's always more to discover.

Potential issue: Does "wanderer" imply you DON'T have a home?
Counter: No—even people with homes can wander. Wandering is a disposition.

## Testing WAYFARER

> "Welcome, Wayfarer."
> "Wayfarers of the Grove."
> "We're all wayfarers here."

Feeling: More purposeful than wanderer. A wayfarer is on a journey WITH direction.
Etymology: "Way" + "farer" = one who travels the way/path.

Wayfarer feels slightly more... intentional. You're not lost. You're finding your way.

## Testing PATHFINDER

> "Welcome, Pathfinder."
> "Pathfinders of the Grove."
> "We find paths. We make paths. We share paths."

Feeling: Active, pioneering, generous (you make paths for others).
Implication: You're not just walking—you're creating routes others can follow.

This could connect to Trails (personal roadmaps): "Pathfinders share their Trails."

## The Inclusivity Question (from PR feedback)

> Does "rooted" unintentionally exclude people who move frequently?

Good point. "Rooted" implies staying put. Some people don't.
"Wanderer" is actually MORE inclusive—everyone can wander.
You don't need to stay forever. You're welcome while you're here.

"Wanderers pass through. Some plant trees. All are welcome."

## A New Progression?

| State | Name | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| Everyone | **Wanderer** | We're all wanderers in this grove |
| Has a blog | **Planted** | You've planted your tree (past action) |
| Subscriber | **Rooted** | You've taken root (deeper commitment) |
| Longtime | **Pathfinder** / **Elder** | You make paths for others |

Or simpler:

| State | Language |
|-------|----------|
| All users | Wanderers |
| Subscribe action | "Take root" / "Plant yourself" |
| Longtime | Deep-rooted / Elder / Pathfinder |

## The Combination That's Emerging

What if **Wanderer** is the universal identity?

Everyone in the grove is a Wanderer.
- Free users wander and explore
- Subscribers have planted but still wander
- Even Autumn is a wanderer (the grove keeper who walks the paths)

**The grove is a place for wanderers.**

And then specific STATES layer on top:
- "Rooted wanderers" = those who've subscribed
- "Pathfinders" = those who share their trails, guide others
- "Elders" = deep-rooted, longtime, respected

> "All wanderers are welcome. Some take root. A few become pathfinders."

## New Top Candidates

1. **Wanderer** (universal identity)
   - Everyone is a wanderer
   - Inclusive, free, exploratory
   - Works for casual and formal
   - "Welcome, Wanderer" / "Fellow wanderers"

2. **Wayfarer** (slightly more purposeful)
   - Same energy but more intentional
   - "Finding your way" rather than "aimless"
   - Slightly more poetic/archaic

3. **Pathfinder** (for established/contributing users)
   - Those who make paths for others
   - Could be an earned title, not default
   - Connects to Trails feature

## What "Rooted" Becomes

If Wanderer is the identity, "rooted" becomes a STATE:
- "A rooted wanderer" = someone who's planted
- "Taking root" = the act of subscribing
- "Deep-rooted" = longtime commitment

You don't STOP being a wanderer when you root.
You become a wanderer with a home.

## The Tagline Test

> "Grove: A place for wanderers."
> "Wanderers welcome. Plant your tree."
> "We're all wanderers here."

vs.

> "Grove: Where the rooted grow."
> "Take root in the Grove."
> "Welcome among the Rooted."

The wanderer framing feels more INVITING.
The rooted framing feels more COMMITTED.

Which is the first impression you want?

## Still Open Questions

1. Is "Wanderer" too common/generic? (D&D, hiking culture, etc.)
2. Does Wayfarer feel more unique/Grove-specific?
3. Should Pathfinder be reserved for a special role/status?
4. Is there a THIRD option that combines rooted AND wandering energy?

*Sitting with this. The grove is quiet. The paths wind on.*

# Resolution: The Grove Identity System

*We found it.*

## The Hierarchy

```
              ✧ WAYFINDER ✧
              (Autumn - singular)
           "She finds the way."
                    │
           ─────────┴─────────
              PATHFINDERS
        (appointed by Wayfinder)
       "They light paths for others."
                    │
           ─────────┴─────────
              THE ROOTED
           (subscribers)
        "They've planted here."
                    │
           ─────────┴─────────
              WANDERERS
              (everyone)
          "All are welcome."
```

## The Names

| Identity | Who | How You Get It | Meaning |
|----------|-----|----------------|---------|
| **Wanderer** | Everyone | Just show up | Exploring the grove, finding your way |
| **Rooted** | Subscribers | Subscribe (take root) | Committed, planted, has a home here |
| **Pathfinder** | Trusted leaders | Appointed by Wayfinder | Lights paths for others, guides wanderers |
| **Wayfinder** | Autumn (singular) | — | Finds the way, tends the grove |

## The Poetry

**Wanderer → Wayfinder** creates beautiful symmetry:
- Wanderer = looking for the way
- Wayfinder = showing the way

**Rooted** is the commitment layer—you've stopped just passing through.

**Pathfinder** is earned trust—you help others navigate.

## Usage Examples

### Greetings & Welcome
- "Welcome, Wanderer."
- "Welcome home, Wanderer. You've taken root."
- "The Wayfinder welcomes you to the grove."

### Community Language
- "Fellow wanderers..."
- "The Rooted know these paths well."
- "Ask a Pathfinder—they'll show you the way."

### About Page / Marketing
- "Grove is a place for wanderers."
- "Plant your tree. Take root. Grow."
- "Some wanderers become Pathfinders. One tends the grove as Wayfinder."

### Subscription Flow
- "Ready to take root?" (CTA)
- "You're one of the Rooted now." (confirmation)
- "Welcome among the Rooted." (email)

## How It Interacts with Tier Names

Tier names (Seedling, Sapling, Oak, Evergreen) describe **subscription level**.
Identity names describe **who you are in the community**.

You can be:
- A Rooted Seedling (new subscriber)
- A Rooted Evergreen (top-tier subscriber)
- A Pathfinder at any tier (appointed by Wayfinder)

They're orthogonal. Tier = what you pay. Identity = who you are.

## Implementation Notes

- **Pathfinder** = similar to existing "Trusted Admins" role
- Only Autumn (Wayfinder) can appoint Pathfinders
- Consider: badge/flair in Meadow? Special icon?
- Consider: Pathfinder-only features? Early access?

## The Story

> You enter the grove as a Wanderer.
> You explore the paths, find the clearings, meet other wanderers.
> Something resonates. You plant your tree. You take root.
> Now you're Rooted—this is home.
>
> Time passes. You learn the paths by heart.
> You help other wanderers find their way.
> The Wayfinder notices. She makes you a Pathfinder.
>
> Now you light the way for others.
> But you never stop wandering.
> None of us do.

*The grove has names now. They fit.*
