## Walking Through...

I enter the grove. The **Lattice** is the structure I don't see—
the trellis behind the vines, holding everything up.

I walk the forest floor, **Foraging** for what I need.
I find the **Meadow** where others gather in sunlight.
I pass through **Shade** where my words are protected.

I look up and see **Foliage**—every tree different,
every canopy unique, colors shifting with seasons.

I count the **Rings** of my own tree—private growth,
years recorded in quiet circles.

My **Heartwood** is my core. Who I am. Verified.

**Ivy** climbs the lattice, connecting point to point—
messages traveling along living threads.

**Amber** holds my treasures suspended in time.
**Patina** protects what matters, layered and weathered.

At the edge, an **Outpost** where friends gather to play.
In a tucked corner, a **Nook** for sharing quietly.

The **Vineyard** shows what's growing, what's being tended.
**Bloom** appears briefly, does its work, fades away.

**Trails** mark my journey—where I've been, where I'm going.
**Waystones** guide me when I'm lost.
**Clearing** shows me the state of things—open, visible.

## The Question: Where Does Support Fit?

When you're in the grove and something's wrong...
When you're lost and Waystone isn't enough...
When you need to actually talk to someone...

What do you do in a forest?

- You don't shout into emptiness (that's Echo's problem)
- You don't just wander (Waystones help with that)
- You don't check a status board (that's Clearing)

You need... connection. Communication. Someone to hear you.

---

## What IS a support ticket in this world?

It's not a place you go.
It's not an object you send.

It's... a reaching out?
A call?
A signal?

In a forest, when you need help:
- You might light a fire (signal)
- You might find a ranger (person)
- You might leave a mark (communication)
- You might knock on a door (seeking connection)

But what if it's more organic than that?

---

## Things in nature that represent "reaching out for help":

- A bird call that gets answered
- Smoke rising (someone sees it)
- A tap on tree roots (mycelium carries signals)
- Sap flowing (the tree's own communication)
- Pollen carried on wind (reaches someone)

---

## Wait. What about the relationship between services?

Waystone = self-service help (trail markers, you follow them)
Clearing = status (you look and see what's happening)
??? = actual human connection (you reach out, someone responds)

The pattern seems to be:
- Some things are PLACES (Meadow, Nook, Pantry, Clearing)
- Some things are OBJECTS/PROCESSES (Amber, Patina, Bloom)
- Some things are FEATURES OF TREES (Foliage, Heartwood, Rings)
- Some things are CONNECTIONS (Ivy, Mycelium, Reeds)

Support tickets feel like... a CONNECTION.
Not a place you go, but a way of reaching someone.

---

## Connection-type names:

Ivy = email (climbing, connecting points)
Mycelium = underground network (invisible connections)
Reeds = comments (whispering together)

What connects you to the grove keeper?
What's the line between you and the person tending this forest?

---

## The Grove Keeper

There's someone tending this grove.
You're a tree. They're the one who checks on the trees.
When you need them... how do you reach them?

In real forests:
- Trees send chemical signals through roots
- Wounded trees release compounds that attract help
- Birds carry messages between areas

What if the support system is about...
REACHING the keeper?
SIGNALING that you need attention?

---

## New directions:

**Tap** - like tapping on roots, sending a signal through the network
**Signal** - too technical
**Beacon** - a light that says "I'm here, I need you"
**Call** - a bird call, expecting response
**Whistle** - a signal through the forest

Or what if it's about what the keeper uses?

**Rounds** - the keeper makes their rounds, checking on trees
**Watch** - the keeper's watch over the grove
**Tend** - to tend to something that needs care

---

## Actually... what if it's simpler?

In the grove, you're a tree.
When something's wrong with a tree, what happens?
Someone notices. Someone tends to it.

The act of asking for help is like...
- Showing a wound
- Dropping leaves unexpectedly
- A branch reaching toward the light

What's the tender moment where you say "I need help"?

---

## The Hollow?

A hollow in a tree is where you leave things.
Where messages are tucked away.
Where owls nest and watch.

"Leave a note in the hollow"

But hollow also means empty... that's bad.

---

## Whisper?

Already conceptually tied to Reeds.

---

## What about time of day / atmosphere?

Dawn - new beginnings
Dusk - endings, transitions
Firefly - small lights in darkness
Cricket - a call that fills the night
Owl - watches, wise, sees in darkness

**Owl** - the wise watcher who answers questions
"Ask the Owl"

But owls are predators too... mixed metaphor.

---

## What about something you FIND in the forest?

A bench. A seat. A resting place.
Where you sit and someone joins you.

**Bench** - "Find the bench. Someone will sit with you."

Hmm. That's kind of nice actually.

Or a **Stump** - an old tree that's now a gathering place
Where the grove keeper sits and listens

---

## The Stump

An old stump in a clearing.
You sit. The keeper sits with you.
You talk about what's wrong.

"Find the stump."

Stump.grove.place

A stump is:
- A place of rest
- Evidence of something that was (history)
- A natural gathering spot
- Where the keeper might sit
- Sturdy, reliable, won't go anywhere

But stump could also feel like... death? An ended tree?

---

## The Hearth (Fireside's already taken sort of)

What about something warmer?

In a forest cabin, you'd go to the hearth.
The fire. The warmth. Where people gather to talk.

But Fireside is already a Wisp mode.

---

## Campfire?

People gather around a campfire to talk.
"Pull up a seat at the campfire."

**Camp** - camping, gathering
**Fire** - warmth, light, gathering point

---

## Let me visualize the support interaction:

```
    You (a tree in the grove, something's wrong)
         |
         | "I need help"
         |
         v
    ┌─────────────────┐
    │   ???.grove     │  <-- What is this?
    │                 │
    │  You write your │
    │  question here  │
    │                 │
    └────────┬────────┘
             |
             | message travels
             |
             v
    ┌─────────────────┐
    │  Grove Keeper   │
    │  (Autumn)       │
    │                 │
    │  Reads, thinks, │
    │  responds       │
    └────────┬────────┘
             |
             | response returns
             |
             v
    ┌─────────────────┐
    │   You           │
    │   (helped!)     │
    └─────────────────┘
```

This is a CONVERSATION.
A back-and-forth.
Not a shout into void.

---

## What in nature is a back-and-forth?

- Call and response (birds)
- Question and answer
- Knock and door opens

What if it's about the response, not the call?

---

## Thinking about Ivy again...

Ivy is email - messages that travel along connections.
Support could be... a special kind of message?

But we want it separate from regular email.

---

## The Keeper's ___?

The Keeper's Ear
The Keeper's Door
The Keeper's Watch
The Keeper's Round

"Knock on the Keeper's door"

---

## Door? Gate?

**Gate** - where you go when you need to enter
**Door** - you knock, someone answers

Gate.grove.place - "Come to the gate"

Hmm, that's actually interesting. A gate is:
- An entrance point
- Where you're welcomed in
- Where a keeper might stand
- A conversation starter

But it's also... exclusionary? Keeping people out?

---

## What if it's about being heard?

**Heard** - "Be heard" - you're not just talking, someone's listening
**Listen** - the place where listening happens

---

## Back to the original question:

What IS a support ticket?

A ticket is:
- A request
- A question
- A conversation thread
- A tracked exchange

In grove terms:
- A reaching out
- A "hey, I need you"
- A thread connecting you to help

---

## THREAD?

A thread in the forest...
Spider silk?
The thread of mycelium?
A thread through a labyrinth?

But thread is very digital/generic.

---

## What keeps coming back to me:

The image of someone sitting on a stump,
or by a fire,
or at a bench,
having a conversation.

It's not about SENDING something.
It's about SITTING WITH someone.

**Bench** - find the bench
**Fireside** - (taken)
**Seat** - (weird)
**Stump** - (maybe death connotation)

---

## What if it's even simpler?

What do you call the act of talking to the person who tends the grove?

You're... checking in?
You're... asking?
You're... visiting?

---

## PORCH

A porch on a cabin in the woods.
You come to the porch. You sit. You talk.
The grove keeper comes out. You have a conversation.

"Come to the porch."

Porch.grove.place

A porch is:
- Welcoming
- A transitional space (outside but connected to inside)
- Where conversations happen
- Where you're greeted
- Informal, warm
- Someone's THERE

---

## Actually... this might be it.

The porch is where you go to talk to someone.
Not a cold ticket system.
Not shouting into void.
Just... come sit on the porch. Let's talk.

*"Have a seat on the porch. We'll figure it out together."*
