# Diagram Mode Naming Journey

*January 7, 2026 — A walk to find what reveals structure*

---

## What Are We Naming?

The **diagram sub-mode** within Weave. The counterpart to Breeze.

What it does:
- Glass cards with Lucide icons
- Static relationships (not animated)
- Flowcharts, architecture diagrams, entity relationships
- Arrows and lines connecting nodes
- **Making structure visible**

The pairing:
- **Breeze** = the invisible force that creates motion
- **???** = the visible structure that shows connection

## What IS This Thing?

### Fundamentally:
- It's about **structure** — showing how things relate
- It's about **visibility** — making the invisible architecture clear
- It's about **static relationships** — not motion, but connection
- It's about **revelation** — what's hidden becomes seen

### What it DOES in the user's life:
- **Reveals** — shows hidden structure
- **Connects** — displays relationships between nodes
- **Maps** — creates visual representation of architecture
- **Clarifies** — makes complex systems understandable

### What emotion should it evoke?
- Clarity
- Discovery
- Understanding
- Seeing the pattern

---

## The Core Question

In a forest, what **reveals structure**? What makes the invisible visible?

### Natural phenomena that reveal:

**Frost** — outlines every branch, every leaf edge, every spider web strand. What was invisible in warmth becomes traced in white.

**Dew** — does the same thing. Morning dew on a spider web makes the web itself visible. The structure was always there; dew reveals it.

**Lichen** — maps the surface of bark. Shows age, shows patterns, shows which side faces north. It's a living map of the tree's history and structure.

**Moss** — grows in patterns that reveal moisture paths, light direction, age. It makes visible what the naked eye might miss.

**Bark patterns** — reveal the structure beneath. The cracks, the texture, the grain all show how the tree grows.

**Spider webs** — they ARE visible structure. They're pure geometry, pure connection, made manifest.

## Walking Through the Forest

I enter the grove. I see my tree—my blog.

I open Terrarium to create a header decoration. I've placed vines and rocks and butterflies.

But now I need something different. I'm working on a technical post about system architecture. I need to show how services connect. How data flows. How components relate.

So I open Weave.

I need to add cards. Service names. System components. I need arrows showing relationships. Dependencies. Data flow.

I don't need motion here. I need **clarity**. I need **structure made visible**.

I switch to... **what**?

What happens when I do?

The canvas clears slightly. The nature assets fade back. Now I see:
- Glass cards waiting for icons
- Connection points ready to link
- A grid for laying out architecture
- The ability to show: "This talks to that. This depends on this. This flow goes here."

It's like walking through morning fog and suddenly seeing the spider webs—outlined in dew, every thread visible, the whole structure revealed.

Or like frost on a window, tracing patterns you couldn't see before.

Or like lichen on bark, mapping what was always there but hidden.

The structure becomes visible. The architecture reveals itself.

---

## Candidates

### 1. Frost

**The thin layer that outlines structure, making invisible things visible**

```
grove.place/weave → Frost mode
```

- What it means in nature: Ice crystals that form on surfaces, outlining every edge, every detail
- Why it fits: Diagrams outline structure. Frost outlines form. Both reveal what's there.
- The vibe: Cold clarity, crystalline precision, morning revelation
- Pairs with Breeze: Breeze is warm air moving; Frost is cold stillness revealing

**Tagline test:**
> "Frost is where structure becomes crystal clear."

**Potential issues:**
- Cold connotation (but that could work—clarity is often described as cold/clear)
- Might feel too winter-specific

---

### 2. Dew

**Moisture that collects and reveals—spider webs invisible until dew shows them**

```
grove.place/weave → Dew mode
```

- What it means in nature: Water droplets that form on surfaces, making spider webs visible
- Why it fits: Perfect metaphor for revealing hidden structure. The web was always there; dew shows it.
- The vibe: Morning clarity, gentle revelation, discovery
- Pairs with Breeze: Breeze dries the dew, or brings it. They're complementary forces.

**Tagline test:**
> "Dew is where hidden connections become visible."

**Potential issues:**
- "Dew" might feel slight/insubstantial
- Could be confused with "do" phonetically

---

### 3. Lichen

**Living organism that maps surfaces, shows patterns, reveals history**

```
grove.place/weave → Lichen mode
```

- What it means in nature: Symbiotic organism that grows on bark, showing age, direction, patterns
- Why it fits: Lichen is nature's diagram—it maps the tree's surface, showing structure
- The vibe: Patient, detailed, revealing over time
- Pairs with Breeze: Breeze is quick/flowing; Lichen is slow/mapping

**Tagline test:**
> "Lichen is where patterns emerge and structure reveals itself."

**Potential issues:**
- Less immediately recognizable than frost/dew
- Pronunciation might be unclear (LIE-ken)
- Slightly clinical/scientific feel

---

### 4. Web

**Spider web—pure visible structure, connection made manifest**

```
grove.place/weave → Web mode
```

- What it means in nature: Spider's web, geometric structure, pure connection
- Why it fits: A web IS a diagram. It's nodes (anchor points) and edges (silk threads). It's literally what we're creating.
- The vibe: Geometric, interconnected, elegant
- Pairs with Breeze: Breeze makes the web visible by moving it

**Tagline test:**
> "Web is where connections take shape."

**Potential issues:**
- "Web" has STRONG internet/WWW associations
- Might be too on-the-nose (web diagram, web mode)
- Loses the nature poetry

---

### 5. Bark

**The visible surface of a tree, showing texture, pattern, structure**

```
grove.place/weave → Bark mode
```

- What it means in nature: The outer layer of a tree, textured and patterned
- Why it fits: Bark reveals the tree's structure—growth rings, scars, patterns
- The vibe: Textured, grounded, structural
- Pairs with Breeze: Breeze rustles leaves; Bark is the solid structure beneath

**Tagline test:**
> "Bark is where structure holds form."

**Potential issues:**
- "Bark" as a verb means dog sound—might be distracting
- Less about revelation, more about just being structure

---

### 6. Trace

**The faint path or outline that remains—showing where something was**

```
grove.place/weave → Trace mode
```

- What it means in nature: Animal tracks, worn paths, evidence of passage
- Why it fits: Diagrams trace relationships. They show paths. They outline structure.
- The vibe: Following paths, detective work, revelation
- Pairs with Breeze: Breeze is invisible; Trace is the visible mark it leaves

**Tagline test:**
> "Trace is where relationships leave their mark."

**Potential issues:**
- Less directly nature-focused
- "Trace" might feel like it's about finding/debugging rather than creating

---

### 7. Grain

**The visible pattern in wood, showing direction of growth and structure**

```
grove.place/weave → Grain mode
```

- What it means in nature: The directional pattern in wood, visible lines showing how tree grew
- Why it fits: Grain shows flow, direction, structure. Like arrows in a diagram.
- The vibe: Natural flow, directional, structural
- Pairs with Breeze: Breeze is flow in air; Grain is flow frozen in wood

**Tagline test:**
> "Grain is where direction becomes visible."

**Potential issues:**
- Might feel too specific to wood
- "Against the grain" has negative connotations

---

### 8. Etching

**Marks carved into surface, revealing pattern and structure**

```
grove.place/weave → Etching mode
```

- What it means in nature: Patterns carved by time, weather, insects—visible marks
- Why it fits: Diagrams are etchings—clean lines, deliberate marks, structure revealed
- The vibe: Precise, permanent, crafted
- Pairs with Breeze: Breeze is ephemeral; Etching is permanent

**Tagline test:**
> "Etching is where structure is carved into clarity."

**Potential issues:**
- Less purely natural (feels more human-craft)
- Slightly formal/technical

---

## Testing the Pairing

Let me test each candidate against **Breeze**:

**Breeze** = the invisible force that creates motion

| Diagram Mode | Pairing Logic | Feel |
|--------------|---------------|------|
| **Frost** | Breeze is warm air moving; Frost reveals when air stills | Strong contrast |
| **Dew** | Breeze and dew are both morning phenomena | Complementary |
| **Lichen** | Breeze moves; Lichen maps what's still | Interesting but disconnected |
| **Web** | Breeze makes the web visible by stirring it | Natural pairing |
| **Bark** | Breeze touches surface; Bark is the surface | Okay but unexciting |
| **Trace** | Breeze leaves no trace; Trace shows what remains | Interesting inversion |
| **Grain** | Breeze flows in air; Grain shows flow in wood | Beautiful parallel |
| **Etching** | Breeze is soft; Etching is sharp | Too much contrast |

---

## The Front-Runners

Three candidates rise to the top:

### 1. **Dew**
- Perfect revelation metaphor (spider web invisible until dew)
- Soft, gentle, morning-fresh
- Pairs naturally with Breeze (both are atmospheric phenomena)
- Makes "hidden connections become visible"

### 2. **Frost**
- Crystal-clear structural revelation
- Outlines every edge, every connection
- Strong visual metaphor
- Pairs with Breeze as complementary forces (warm/cold)

### 3. **Grain**
- Shows directional flow and structure
- Beautiful parallel: Breeze = flow in air, Grain = flow in wood
- Feels grounded and natural
- Reveals the path of growth

Let me test them more deeply...

## Deep Dive: Dew

**The spider web moment.**

You're walking through the forest at dawn. You can't see the spider webs—they're invisible threads between branches.

Then the sun rises. Dew forms. Suddenly every web is outlined in droplets of light. The structure was always there. Now you can see it.

**That's what this mode does.**

The relationships exist in your system. But they're invisible. You open Dew mode, and you map them out. Glass cards. Icons. Arrows between them.

The architecture becomes visible. The connections outlined in light.

```
Breeze: invisible force that creates motion
Dew: visible droplets that reveal structure
```

They're both atmospheric phenomena. Both ephemeral. Both beautiful.

**Use case:**
"I'm building a system architecture diagram in Dew."
"Switch to Dew mode to show the relationships."
"My blog post has a flowchart—I created it in Dew."

**Tagline:**
> "Dew is where hidden connections become visible."

**Full entry:**

## Dew
**Diagram Mode** · *Within Weave*

A spider's web is invisible in the dark. You can walk right through it without seeing a thread. But at dawn, when dew forms, every strand becomes outlined in droplets of light. The structure was always there. Now you can see it.

Dew is the diagram mode within Weave. Place glass cards with icons on a canvas, draw arrows showing relationships, and map out the architecture. Flowcharts for blog posts. System diagrams for technical writing. Entity relationships for planning. The invisible structure of your ideas, outlined in light.

The web was always there. Dew makes it visible.

*Clarity at dawn.*

---

## Deep Dive: Frost

**The window pane moment.**

You look through a window on a cold morning. The glass is covered in frost—delicate crystalline patterns tracing every current of air, every irregularity in the surface.

Frost doesn't create structure. It **reveals** it.

**That's what this mode does.**

You have a system. Components. Dependencies. Data flows. They're abstract, invisible.

You open Frost mode. You place nodes. Draw edges. The architecture crystallizes. Every connection outlined in sharp, clear lines.

```
Breeze: warm force moving through
Frost: cold clarity making visible
```

They're atmospheric opposites. Frost forms when breeze stills. When motion stops, structure reveals.

**Use case:**
"I'm mapping the system architecture in Frost."
"Switch to Frost to see the connections clearly."
"My technical diagram is in Frost mode."

**Tagline:**
> "Frost is where structure becomes crystal clear."

**Full entry:**

## Frost
**Diagram Mode** · *Within Weave*

On cold mornings, frost traces patterns across windows—delicate crystals that form on surfaces, outlining every edge, every hidden current of air. Frost doesn't create structure; it reveals what was always there, making the invisible visible through perfect, crystalline clarity.

Frost is the diagram mode within Weave. Place glass cards with icons, draw connections between them, and map the architecture of your ideas. System diagrams, flowcharts, entity relationships—all the invisible structure of how things connect, outlined in sharp, clear lines. When motion stills, structure reveals itself.

The architecture was always there. Frost makes it crystal clear.

*Cold clarity.*

---

## Deep Dive: Grain

**The woodworker's moment.**

You're looking at a piece of wood. Cut cross-section. The grain is visible—lines flowing through it, showing direction, showing how it grew, showing where stress happened.

Grain isn't decoration. It's **visible flow**. It's structure made manifest.

**That's what this mode does.**

You have flows. Data flow. Process flow. Dependencies flowing from here to there.

You open Grain mode. The flows become visible. Arrows showing direction. Cards showing nodes. The grain of your system laid bare.

```
Breeze: flow in air (invisible)
Grain: flow in wood (visible)
```

Beautiful parallel. One is ephemeral, the other is frozen in time. Both are about flow.

**Use case:**
"I'm showing the data flow in Grain."
"Switch to Grain mode to map the dependencies."
"My process diagram follows the grain."

**Tagline:**
> "Grain is where flow becomes visible."

**Full entry:**

## Grain
**Diagram Mode** · *Within Weave*

Cut a piece of wood and you'll see its grain—the visible pattern of how it grew, lines flowing through it showing direction, stress, history. Grain isn't decoration; it's structure made manifest. It shows the flow that was invisible when the tree was standing.

Grain is the diagram mode within Weave. Map the flow of your systems: data moving between services, processes depending on other processes, entities relating to one another. Place cards, draw arrows, and reveal the grain of your architecture. The flow was always there; Grain makes it visible.

Follow the grain. See where it leads.

*Flow made visible.*

---

## The Choice

After walking through all three deeply, I keep returning to **Dew**.

### Why Dew?

1. **Perfect revelation metaphor**: The spider web invisible until morning dew reveals it. That's EXACTLY what diagramming does—makes invisible relationships visible.

2. **Pairs beautifully with Breeze**:
   - Both are atmospheric phenomena
   - Both are gentle, natural forces
   - Breeze moves; Dew reveals
   - They happen together (morning breeze brings dew)

3. **The right emotional tone**:
   - Not cold (like Frost)
   - Not structural/heavy (like Grain)
   - Gentle, clarifying, morning-fresh

4. **Works in sentences naturally**:
   - "I'm creating a diagram in Dew"
   - "Switch to Dew mode"
   - "My architecture is mapped out in Dew"

5. **Fits Grove's voice**:
   - Soft, natural, poetic
   - About revelation and clarity
   - Accessible to everyone (everyone has seen morning dew)

### Why not Frost?

Frost is beautiful, but it's **cold**. Grove is warm. Frost implies winter, stillness, sometimes death. Dew implies morning, freshness, life beginning.

### Why not Grain?

Grain is about flow, which is compelling. But it's very specific to wood. And "going against the grain" has negative connotations. Grain is beautiful but too narrow.

### The pairing

| Mode | Name | Nature Phenomenon | What it Does |
|------|------|-------------------|--------------|
| Animation | **Breeze** | Invisible force creating motion | Brings scenes to life through chained movement |
| Diagrams | **Dew** | Visible droplets revealing structure | Makes invisible relationships visible |

Both are morning phenomena.
Both are gentle forces.
Breeze moves. Dew reveals.
Together, they wake the forest.

## The Final Entry

## Dew
**Diagram Mode** · *Within Weave*

Walk through a forest at dawn. You can't see the spider webs—invisible threads stretched between branches. Then the sun rises. Dew forms. Suddenly every web is outlined in droplets of light, each strand visible, the whole structure revealed. The web was always there. Dew makes it visible.

Dew is the diagram mode within Weave. Map the invisible architecture of your systems: place glass cards with icons, draw arrows showing relationships, create flowcharts and entity diagrams and system maps. Technical writing, planning documents, any time you need to show how things connect. The relationships exist. Dew makes them clear.

The structure was always there. Dew outlines it in light.

*Clarity at dawn.*

---

## Icon Considerations

For Dew mode, the icon should suggest:
- Droplets
- Connection points
- Clarity/revelation
- Static structure

Possible Lucide icons:
- `droplets` — literal dew
- `git-graph` — shows branching structure
- `network` — shows connection nodes
- `workflow` — shows process flow
- `git-branch-plus` — nodes and connections

Recommendation: **`droplets`** for the poetic match, or **`network`** for the functional match.

## Final Comparison Table

| Tool | Mode | Name | Internal Name | Icon | What It Does |
|------|------|------|---------------|------|--------------|
| Weave | Studio | Weave | GroveWeave | `spline-pointer` | Node-graph canvas |
| | Animation | Breeze | GroveBreeze | `wind` | Motion propagating through chains |
| | Diagrams | Dew | GroveDew | `droplets` or `network` | Static structure and relationships |
| | Connections | Threads | GroveThreads | `route` | The lines between nodes |
