## Custom Domains

### Bring Your Own Domain (Oak+)

Already have a domain? Connect it to your Grove blog at no extra cost. Available on Oak and Evergreen tiers.

### Domain Search Service (Evergreen)

Don't have a domain yet? Our AI-powered domain search tool finds the perfect domain for your blog—turning what's normally a 2-week search into 1-2 hours.

| Turnaround | Setup Fee | Credited As |
|:----------:|:---------:|:-----------:|
| Same Day | $200 | 4 months Evergreen |
| 3 Days | $100 | 2 months Evergreen |
| 1 Week | $50 | 1 month Evergreen |

**Setup fees are credited toward your subscription**—you're not losing money, you're prepaying for service.

**Domain registration** (~$20/year for standard domains) is included in your Evergreen subscription for domains up to $100/year. Premium TLDs over $100/year: you cover the difference.

### Your Domain, Your Ownership

When we register a domain for you, **you own it**. If you ever leave Grove:
- Transfer your domain to any registrar
- We provide authorization codes within 48 hours
- No transfer fees, no hostage situations

## Revenue Transparency

Grove is built to be sustainable, not extractive. Infrastructure costs (Cloudflare R2, D1, Workers) stay under 0.5% of revenue at any scale. Your subscription directly supports:

- Platform development and improvements
- Support staff (currently just Autumn)
- Domain registration costs (Evergreen tier)
- Email infrastructure
- Keeping the lights on

No venture capital. No investor pressure to maximize extraction. Just a service that earns its keep.
