# *Pricing & Subscription Tiers*

Grove.place

*Effective December 2025*

## Pricing Philosophy

Grove.place is designed to be **accessible**. The goal is to provide a home for writers and creators at every level — from hobbyists exploring blogging for the first time to professionals who need a polished, branded presence.

Setup fees for domain services are **credited toward subscription** — they're not lost money, they're prepayment for service.
