## Overview

Grove respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects our users to do the same. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") and other applicable laws.

If you believe that your copyrighted work has been copied and is accessible on Grove in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please follow the procedures outlined below.

3. **Your contact information**, including:
   - Your name

## 3. Repeat Infringer Policy

Grove maintains a policy of terminating accounts of users who are repeat infringers.

### 3.1 Definition
A "repeat infringer" is a user who:
- Has been the subject of **two or more valid DMCA takedown notices** for different works
- Has had content removed for copyright infringement **on multiple occasions**

### 3.2 Consequences
Users identified as repeat infringers will have their accounts **terminated** and may be **permanently banned** from Grove.

### 3.3 Consideration
We consider all relevant factors when determining whether someone is a repeat infringer, including:
- Whether the user filed valid counter-notifications
- Whether previous notices were for the same or different works
- The timeframe of the alleged infringements
- Whether the user appears to be acting in good faith

## 4. Misrepresentation Warning

**Please be aware:** Under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material is infringing, or that material was removed by mistake, may be subject to liability for damages, including costs and attorneys' fees.

**Do not file a DMCA notice unless you are certain** that the content infringes your copyright. If you are unsure whether certain content constitutes infringement, please consult an attorney before submitting a notice.
