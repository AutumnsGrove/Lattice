## 1. Agreement to Terms

By accessing or using Grove ("the Service"), operated by Autumn ("we," "us," or "our"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Service.

The Service is offered to users in the United States only. By using the Service, you represent that you are located in the United States.

---

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least **18 years of age** to use the Service. By using Grove, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement.

---

## 3. Description of Service

Grove is a multi-tenant blogging platform that provides:

- Personal blog hosting on subdomains (username.grove.place)
- Markdown-based content creation and publishing
- Media storage and delivery
- Optional community features (Meadow)
- Custom domain support (Oak and Evergreen tiers)

The Service is provided on a subscription basis with different tiers offering varying features and limits.

### 3.1 Blog Access

**Public by Default:** All Grove blogs are publicly accessible by default. Anyone can visit and read your blog without logging in or creating an account. When you publish a post, it becomes visible to the public internet unless you have enabled privacy controls.

**Privacy Controls (Evergreen tier only):** Users on the Evergreen subscription tier may choose to require login for blog access. When enabled, **any authenticated Grove user (including free accounts) can view the blog**—this is not granular access control. You cannot restrict access to specific individuals or groups through this feature. If you need granular permissions (e.g., allowlists, paid subscriber-only access, or team-specific viewing), contact us about custom enterprise plans.

**Meadow Access:** The Meadow community feed requires a free Grove account to browse and interact with.
