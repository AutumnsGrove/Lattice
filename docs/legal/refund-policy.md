## Our Philosophy

We want you to love Grove. If it's not right for you, we make it easy to get your money back or cancel your subscription. No hoops, no hassle.

---

## 1. Refund Policy

### 1.1 Within 14 Days (Full Refund)

If you're not satisfied with Grove, you can request a **full refund within 14 days** of your initial subscription or any renewal payment.

- No questions asked
- Full amount refunded to your original payment method
- Refund processed within 5-10 business days

### 1.2 After 14 Days (Pro-Rated Refund)

After the 14-day period, you may still request a refund. We will provide a **pro-rated refund** for the unused portion of your current billing period.

**Example:** If you're on the Sapling plan ($12/month) and cancel on day 20 of your billing cycle, you would receive approximately $4 back (10 unused days ÷ 30 days × $12).

### 1.3 How to Request a Refund

To request a refund, email us at:

**Email:** hello@grove.place
**Subject:** Refund Request

Please include:
- Your account email address
- The reason for your refund request (optional, but helps us improve)

We will process your request within **3 business days**.

We send a payment reminder email **5 days before** your subscription renews (day 25 of your billing cycle). This gives you time to:

You have a **7-day grace period** to resolve payment issues. During this time:

After the grace period, your account will be suspended and your data archived.
