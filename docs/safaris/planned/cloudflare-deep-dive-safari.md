# Cloudflare Deep Dive Safari — Research vs Reality

> *The research painted a map. The codebase told the truth. This journal records where they agree, where they diverge, and what actually matters.*
>
> **Aesthetic principle**: Honest observation before architectural ambition
> **Scope**: 9 service proposals from `cloudflare-infrastructure-deep-dive.md` cross-referenced against the living codebase

-----

## Ecosystem Overview

**9 stops** across the Grove × Cloudflare research document, each evaluated for:
- What the research claims about current state
- What actually exists in the codebase
- Whether the proposed integration makes sense given reality

### The Critical Finding

The research document is **directionally correct** on its core thesis — CF Queues and Workflows are genuinely the missing primitives in Grove's Cloudflare stack. But it has **significant accuracy gaps** about the current state of several services, which changes the implementation strategy.

### Items by Category

**Thriving** 🟢: Loom SDK, Forage
**Growing** 🟡: Amber, Ivy, Meadow
**Wilting** 🟠: Thorn & Petal, Firefly SDK
**Barren** 🔴: Wander
**Critical gap**: CF Queues & Workflows (zero usage across the entire codebase)

-----

## 1. Loom SDK — The Foundation 🟢

**Character**: The coordination layer that turned 9 copy-paste DOs into a consistent, tested framework.

### Research claim
> "Loom already abstracts the hard parts of the DO pattern. The natural evolution: queue integration, Workflow integration."

### Codebase reality

The Loom SDK at `libs/engine/src/lib/loom/` is **complete and in production**:

- [x] `LoomDO` abstract base class — full lifecycle management (`base.ts`, 302 lines)
- [x] `LoomLogger` — structured logging per DO instance
- [x] `AlarmScheduler` — deduped alarm scheduling
- [x] `WebSocketManager` — hibernation-aware WebSocket management
- [x] `SqlHelper` + `JsonStore` — SQL helpers and JSON key-value persistence
- [x] `matchRoute` + `buildRequestContext` — declarative route matching
- [x] `PromiseLockMap` — promise dedup locks
- [x] `getLoomStub`, `loomFetch`, `loomFetchJson` — factory helpers
- [x] `LOOM_ERRORS` + `LoomResponse` — error system
- [x] SvelteKit adapter (`adapters/sveltekit.ts`)
- [x] Worker adapter (`adapters/worker.ts`)
- [x] Test utilities (`test-utils.ts`)
- [x] **9 production DOs using it**: TenantDO, PostMetaDO, PostContentDO, SentinelDO, ExportDO, TriageDO, ThresholdDO, ExportJobV2, SearchJobDO

**Accuracy verdict**: Research undersells this. Loom is done — not "emerging." The SDK is the right place for queue/workflow integration.

### Design spec (safari-approved)

Loom is ready for the next layer — event emission and workflow triggering:

- [ ] Add `this.emit(event, payload)` to LoomDO base class → routes to CF Queue when available, no-op otherwise
- [ ] Add `this.workflow(name, params)` to LoomDO → triggers CF Workflow from DO state changes
- [ ] Keep backward compatible — new methods are optional, existing DOs unchanged
- [ ] Add `loom/queue.ts` adapter with queue producer helpers

-----

## 2. Forage — The Proven Pattern 🟢

**Character**: The pioneer. First Loom-style service. Living proof the DO + LLM + alarm-based batch chaining pattern works.

### Research claim
> "The Forage pattern generalizes: Request → Worker → LLM generates task list → push N tasks to queue → N consumer Workers execute in parallel → aggregate results."

### Codebase reality

Forage at `services/forage/` is **fully built and on Loom SDK**:

- [x] `SearchJobDO extends LoomDO` with SQLite state (`durable-object.ts`)
- [x] `agents/driver.ts` — LLM generates domain candidates
- [x] `agents/swarm.ts` — LLM evaluates and filters candidates
- [x] `rdap.ts` + `cerebras-rdap.ts` — domain availability checking
- [x] `providers/` — OpenRouter, DeepSeek provider abstraction
- [x] `pricing.ts` — domain pricing lookup
- [x] `email.ts` — result delivery via Zephyr
- [x] Alarm-based batch chaining for multi-step searches

**Accuracy verdict**: The pattern description is accurate. The gap: Forage uses alarm-based sequential batching within one DO, not queue-based parallel fan-out. True parallelism would require queues.

### Design spec (safari-approved)

- [ ] Extract "LLM generates candidates → batch check → aggregate" into a reusable agentic pattern
- [ ] When CF Queues land in Grove, Forage is the first migration candidate for true parallel fan-out
- [ ] DO stays as coordinator/memory; queue handles parallelism
- [ ] Keep alarm-based chaining as fallback for environments without queues

-----

## 3. Amber — File Storage 🟡

**Character**: The amber-resin keeper — file uploads, R2 storage, export zips.

### Research claim
> "File processing likely happens synchronously... no guaranteed retry if processing fails." Proposes `amber-processing-queue`.

### Codebase reality

- [x] `apps/amber/` — SvelteKit frontend (FileGrid, StorageMeter, UsageBreakdown, TrashBin)
- [x] `services/amber/` — Worker backend with ExportJobV2 on Loom SDK (alarm-based durable export jobs)
- [x] R2 bucket (`grove-storage`) for media
- [x] Cron triggers (`*/5 * * * *`, `0 3 * * *`) for periodic cleanup
- [x] Heartwood auth via service binding
- [ ] **No image processing pipeline** — no compression, no WebP, no thumbnails
- [ ] **No queue** — cron-based cleanup only

**Accuracy verdict**: Partially correct. Export jobs DO have durable state via Loom DO. But there's no media processing pipeline at all — it's not "synchronous and hopeful," it doesn't exist yet.

### Design spec (safari-approved)

- [ ] When media processing is built, start with CF Queue: upload → R2 (instant) → queue → process
- [ ] Consumer: WebP conversion, thumbnail generation (100px, 400px), EXIF stripping
- [ ] ExportJobV2 demonstrates the DO + alarm pattern; image processing could follow similar model
- [ ] CF Queue would be better than alarm chaining for parallel thumbnail generation across multiple sizes

-----

## 4. Ivy — Email 🟡

**Character**: The most complex service in the ecosystem. Full email client, triage, AI classification, digest scheduling.

### Research claim
> "Email sending inline with request handlers means one slow/failed Resend API call affects the user-facing response."

### Codebase reality

- [x] `apps/ivy/` — Full SvelteKit email client (compose, thread list, email view, search)
- [x] `services/zephyr/` — Centralized email gateway (Hono Worker) with auth, rate limiting, unsubscribe, D1 logging
- [x] `services/email-render/` — Email template rendering service
- [x] `TriageDO` on Loom SDK — alarm-based email classification (~10 emails per alarm)
- [x] AI classification via Lumen (Workers AI + OpenRouter)
- [x] Digest scheduling (8am/1pm/6pm configurable)
- [x] `workers/email-catchup/` — email catchup worker
- [x] Webhook handler for inbound email processing
- [ ] **Queue handler is a STUB**: `throw new Error("Not implemented")` (`apps/ivy/src/workers/queue/handler.ts`)
- [ ] **Cron polling** (`* * * * *`) instead of event-driven queue
- [ ] **No CF Queue** integration
- [ ] **No drip onboarding Workflow**

**Accuracy verdict**: Directionally correct but mischaracterizes architecture. Email sending isn't "inline" — Zephyr is already a separate Worker. TriageDO already does async processing via alarms. The real gaps: stub queue, no drip Workflows, no spike absorption.

### Design spec (safari-approved)

**Ivy is the #1 candidate for CF Queues:**

- [ ] Replace stub queue handler with real CF Queue consumer
- [ ] `ivy-transactional-queue` (high priority): welcome, password reset, verification
- [ ] `ivy-digest-queue` (batch priority): weekly digests, notification rollups
- [ ] TriageDO becomes queue producer: classified email → appropriate queue → Zephyr delivery
- [ ] Drip onboarding as CF Workflow: Day 0 welcome → sleep 24h → Day 1 nudge → sleep 6d → Week 1 tips
- [ ] Zephyr service binding pattern already solid — queues sit between callers and Zephyr

-----

## 5. Meadow — Social Feed 🟡

**Character**: The open sky — RSS-based community feed with dedicated poll and sync workers.

### Research claim
> "Publishing a post likely triggers synchronous feed updates — a fan-out problem." Proposes `meadow-fanout-queue`.

### Codebase reality

- [x] `apps/meadow/` — SvelteKit feed (posts, bookmarks, reactions, notes, compose)
- [x] `workers/meadow-poller/` — RSS fetcher, cron every 15 min, KV for poll state
- [x] `workers/timeline-sync/` — Nightly AI timeline summaries (1 AM UTC), per-tenant API keys
- [x] KV caching for feed pages (2-min TTL)
- [x] ThresholdDO for rate limiting
- [x] D1 for posts, reactions, bookmarks, follows, votes
- [x] Server modules: `feed.ts`, `follows.ts`, `reactions.ts`, `bookmarks.ts`, `notes.ts`, `votes.ts`
- [ ] **No queue-based fan-out** — RSS pull model, not push
- [ ] **No push notifications**
- [ ] **No scheduled posts**

**Accuracy verdict**: Misleading. Meadow uses an RSS pull model, not push. The bottleneck isn't fan-out; it's polling frequency and D1 write throughput. The research assumes a push architecture that doesn't exist.

### Design spec (safari-approved)

**Meadow's actual needs differ from the research proposal:**

- [ ] Queue between `meadow-poller` and D1 writes — batch RSS results for efficient D1 upsert
- [ ] Scheduled posts via Workflow: future timestamp → sleep → publish pipeline (RSS + Meadow + Zephyr)
- [ ] `timeline-sync` as queue consumer: push one message per tenant → parallel summary generation
- [ ] The "fan-out" problem becomes real only if/when Meadow transitions from RSS pull to push-based real-time feed

## 6. Thorn & Petal — Content Moderation 🟠

**Character**: Protective brambles. Functional libraries integrated via `waitUntil()` hooks. No standalone Workers or queue-based pipeline.

### Research claim
> "Current state: Worker sequence — Workers calling Workers, hoping they scale."

### Codebase reality

**Thorn** (`libs/engine/src/lib/thorn/`) — LIBRARY, LIVE:
- [x] `moderate.ts` — Core moderation via Lumen AI client (3-model cascade: GPT-oss Safeguard → LlamaGuard 4 → DeepSeek V3.2)
- [x] `config.ts` — Graduated enforcement: allow/warn/flag_review/block with per-content-type sensitivity (blog_post permissive, comment strict, profile_bio moderate). Global thresholds: 0.4 (allow below), 0.95 (block above).
- [x] `hooks.ts` — `moderatePublishedContent()` called via `waitUntil()` on post publish/edit. Fire-and-forget, never throws.
- [x] `logging.ts` — D1 tables: `thorn_moderation_log` (audit trail, 90-day retention), `thorn_flagged_content` (review queue with pending/cleared/removed status)
- [x] `thorn.test.ts` — 22 test cases covering decision logic and integration
- [x] **Name is Thorn** — naming journey explored "Resin" as an alternative but the rename was never applied; all code remains `thorn/`

**Petal** (`libs/engine/src/lib/server/petal/`) — LIBRARY, LIVE:
- [x] `layer1-csam.ts` — CSAM detection (PhotoDNA primary, awaiting Microsoft approval; falls back to vision model)
- [x] `layer2-classify.ts` — Content classification via Workers AI (Llama 4 Scout primary → Llama 3.2 Vision fallback → Together.ai tertiary)
- [x] `layer3-sanity.ts` — Context-aware sanity checks (face detection, screenshot detection, quality scoring, per-context requirements for tryon/profile/blog/general)
- [x] `layer4-output.ts` — AI-generated output verification
- [x] `vision-client.ts` — Provider cascade with circuit breaker (3 failures → 60s cooldown)
- [x] `photodna-client.ts` — PhotoDNA Cloud Service integration
- [x] Full config (`libs/engine/src/lib/config/petal.ts`, 375 lines) — provider cascade, 12 content categories, confidence thresholds, rate limits, sanity requirements, classification prompts
- [x] D1 migrations: `030_petal.sql`, `031_petal_upload_gate.sql`
- [x] Tests: `petal.test.ts`, `petal-integration.test.ts`, `lumen-classify.test.ts`

**What's missing (not library code — infrastructure):**
- [ ] **No standalone moderation Workers** — no `services/thorn/`, `services/petal/`
- [ ] **No queue-based processing** — moderation runs inside main app Worker via `waitUntil()`
- [ ] **No guaranteed retry** — if `waitUntil()` fails silently, moderation is skipped with no record
- [ ] **No human review UI** — `thorn_flagged_content` table exists but no admin interface
- [ ] **No durable moderation pipeline** — no state persistence between scan and review

**Accuracy verdict**: Research was wrong about the *current state* — there's no "Worker chain hoping they scale." The reality is better: functional, tested libraries with `waitUntil()` integration. But the research was right about the *gap*: no retry guarantees, no durability, no queue-based decoupling.

### Design spec (safari-approved)

**Libraries are ready — wrap them in queues for reliability:**

- [x] Thorn library is ready: moderation logic, thresholds, logging, all tested
- [x] Petal config is ready: providers, categories, thresholds all defined
- [ ] Build moderation service with CF Queues (wrapping existing libraries):
  - `petal-scan-queue` (images) → consumer calls existing `scanImage()` from Petal library
  - `thorn-scan-queue` (text) → consumer calls existing `moderateContent()` from Thorn library
  - `moderation-review-queue` (flagged content) → human review via Workflow
- [ ] `ModerationWorkflow` from research doc is solid — wraps existing library calls with durable state
- [ ] Build admin review UI for `thorn_flagged_content` and Petal security logs

-----

## 7. Wander — Discovery 🔴

**Character**: A mirage.

### Research claim
> "Exploration and discovery mode." Proposes queues for preference signals and agentic Workflows.

### Codebase reality

- **"Wanderer" is a user identity term** — means "everyone who enters Grove" (AGENT.md)
- **No `apps/wander/`**, **no `services/wander/`**, **no `workers/wander-*/`**
- **No discovery/recommendation code of any kind**

**Accuracy verdict**: The research treats Wander as an existing service. It does not exist. This is a greenfield feature proposal mislabeled as an infrastructure upgrade.

### Design spec (safari-approved)

- [ ] If/when Wander is built, the research's DO + Workflow + agentic architecture is sound
- [ ] This is a Phase 6+ feature, not an infrastructure upgrade to existing code
- [ ] Building blocks are ready: Loom SDK for DOs, Meadow signals for data, Forage pattern for agentic fan-out
- [ ] Research document should flag this as "future service" not "current service needing queues"

-----

## 8. Firefly SDK — Server Provisioning 🟠

**Character**: Ephemeral light. Fully designed, not built.

### Research claim
> "This is the most natural Workflow candidate in the entire Grove ecosystem."

### Codebase reality

- [x] Full SDK spec: `docs/specs/firefly-sdk-spec.md` — provider-agnostic with ignite/illuminate/fade lifecycle
- [x] Queen coordinator spec: `docs/specs/queen-firefly-coordinator-spec.md` — DO coordinator for runner pools
- [x] Pattern doc: `docs/patterns/firefly-pattern.md` — design philosophy
- [ ] **No production code** — no `services/firefly/`, no SDK implementation
- [ ] **No Queen DO** — spec only
- [ ] **No Hetzner provider** — spec only

**Accuracy verdict**: Correct that Firefly is a natural Workflow candidate. But there's nothing to migrate — it would be built Workflow-first from scratch.

### Design spec (safari-approved)

- [ ] Build Firefly Workflow-first: `FireflyProvisionWorkflow` from research doc is solid
- [ ] Queen DO on Loom SDK coordinates pools; Workflow handles multi-step lifecycle
- [ ] Queue for CI job submission — fan-out across available runners
- [ ] Provider-agnostic SDK as spec describes

-----

## 9. CF Queues & Workflows — The Missing Layer ⚠️

**Character**: The infrastructure gap. Zero Cloudflare Queues. Zero Cloudflare Workflows. Anywhere.

### What Grove uses instead

| Pattern needed | Current workaround | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Async job queue | Cron triggers (polling) | Amber `*/5 * * * *`, Ivy `* * * * *`, Meadow `*/15 * * * *` |
| Durable multi-step | Alarm-based DO chaining | Forage SearchJobDO, Amber ExportDO, Ivy TriageDO |
| Background processing | Dedicated Workers | meadow-poller, timeline-sync, email-catchup, warden |
| Event routing | Service bindings | AUTH, ZEPHYR throughout |

### What's NOT happening because of the gap

- No retry-on-failure for email sending (Zephyr → Resend is inline)
- No spike absorption (mass notifications = mass synchronous sends)
- No parallel fan-out (Forage batches sequentially in DO alarms)
- No durable lifecycle processes (onboarding drip, server provisioning, moderation review)

**Accuracy verdict**: This is the strongest claim in the research. Queues and Workflows genuinely ARE the missing primitives.

### Design spec (safari-approved) — The Adoption Roadmap

**Phase 1: First CF Queue — Ivy transactional email**
- [ ] Add `[[queues.producers]]` and `[[queues.consumers]]` to wrangler config
- [ ] Replace cron-based send queue with CF Queue consumer
- [ ] Immediate benefit: retry on Resend failure, spike absorption, decoupled send path

**Phase 2: Meadow poller → queue**
- [ ] meadow-poller pushes per-tenant RSS results to queue
- [ ] Consumer batches D1 upserts efficiently

**Phase 3: First CF Workflow — Ivy onboarding drip**
- [ ] Day 0 welcome → sleep 24h → nudge → sleep 6d → tips
- [ ] Replaces need for scheduled DB polling

**Phase 4: Loom integration**
- [ ] Add `this.emit()` to LoomDO base → routes to CF Queue
- [ ] Any DO state change can trigger background work without direct service calls

**Phase 5: Future greenfield services**
- [ ] Petal/Thorn moderation — wrap libraries in queues
- [ ] Firefly provisioning — build Workflow-first
- [ ] Wander discovery — build with full stack (DO + Queue + Workflow)

## Expedition Summary

### By the Numbers

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total stops | 9 |
| Thriving 🟢 | 2 (Loom SDK, Forage) |
| Growing 🟡 | 3 (Amber, Ivy, Meadow) |
| Wilting 🟠 | 2 (Thorn/Petal, Firefly) |
| Barren 🔴 | 1 (Wander) |
| Critical gap | 1 (Queues/Workflows) |
| Total fix items | 31 |

### Research Document Accuracy Scorecard

| Service | Current State Accuracy | Proposal Quality |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Loom SDK | ⚠️ Undersold — it's fully built, not emerging | ✅ Right next step (add emit/workflow) |
| Forage | ✅ Pattern description accurate | ✅ Queue migration makes sense |
| Amber | ⚠️ No processing pipeline exists to fix | ✅ Queue-first when building |
| Ivy | ⚠️ Architecture mischaracterized (Zephyr exists) | ✅ Best queue candidate |
| Meadow | ❌ Assumes push model; reality is RSS pull | ⚠️ Different problems than proposed |
| Thorn/Petal | ❌ "Worker chain" doesn't exist — they're libraries via `waitUntil()` | ✅ Wrap existing libraries in queues for reliability |
| Wander | ❌ Service doesn't exist at all | ✅ Solid greenfield design |
| Firefly | ⚠️ Nothing to "migrate from" | ✅ Workflow-first makes sense |
| Queues/Workflows | ✅ Accurately identifies the gap | ✅ Adoption roadmap is sound |

### Recommended Trek Order

1. **Ivy + Queues** — highest ROI. Replace the stub queue handler with a real CF Queue. Most mature service with the clearest gap.
2. **Loom SDK + emit()** — small surface area, high leverage. Every DO becomes a queue producer.
3. **Meadow + Queues** — decouple poller from D1 writes. Immediate throughput improvement.
4. **Ivy + Workflow** — onboarding drip sequence. First Workflow in production.
5. **Petal/Thorn** — wrap existing libraries in CF Queues for reliability and add admin review UI.
6. **Firefly** — when server provisioning is built, build Workflow-first using the comprehensive specs.
7. **Forage** — migrate from alarm-based to queue-based parallel fan-out.
8. **Wander** — greenfield, full stack, Phase 6+.

### Cross-Cutting Themes

1. **The research oversells the current problem.** Several services described as "needing migration" either don't exist or don't have the problems described. The real wins are: (a) adding queues to Ivy/Meadow's existing cron patterns, and (b) building new services queue-first/Workflow-first.

2. **Loom SDK is the linchpin.** Every queue and workflow integration should flow through Loom. The `emit()` and `workflow()` additions to LoomDO would make the entire DO fleet event-capable in one change.

3. **Cron → Queue is the migration pattern.** Three services (Amber, Ivy, Meadow) all use cron triggers as a poor substitute for event-driven queues. The migration path is consistent: replace cron polling with CF Queue consumers.

4. **Alarm chaining → Workflows is the other migration.** Forage, ExportDO, and TriageDO all use alarm-based multi-step execution. For truly complex multi-step processes (Firefly, onboarding), CF Workflows would be more appropriate.

5. **Build new services on the full stack from day one.** Petal/Thorn queue wrappers, Firefly, and Wander should all be built with DOs + Queues + Workflows from the start. The Thorn and Petal libraries provide the moderation logic — queues and workflows provide the reliability layer.

-----

### Corrections the Research Document Needs

| Section | Issue | Correction |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Loom SDK | Described as early/emerging | Loom SDK is fully built with 9 production DOs |
| Thorn & Petal | "Worker chain hoping they scale" | No production moderation pipeline exists |
| Wander | Treated as existing service | Wander does not exist; "Wanderer" is user identity term |
| Meadow | "Synchronous fan-out problem" | Uses RSS pull model, not push fan-out |
| Ivy | "Email sending inline with request handlers" | Zephyr is already a separate gateway Worker |
| Amber | "Synchronous processing" | No media processing pipeline exists to be synchronous |
| Firefly | Implies migration from Workers | Nothing built to migrate from |
