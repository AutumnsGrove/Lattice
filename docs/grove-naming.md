# The Grove Naming System

> *A forest of voices. Every user is a tree in the grove.*

## The Philosophy

The internet used to be a place of personal expression. Somewhere along the way, we traded that for algorithms and engagement metrics. Grove is a return to something simpler—a place where people can plant their thoughts and watch them grow.

These names aren't just branding. They're the language of an ecosystem. Each one draws from the same soil: forests, growth, shelter, connection. Beneath the surface, roots intermingle. Trees share nutrients through mycorrhizal networks. The oldest trees nurture the saplings. 

This is how we build.

---

## Meadow
**The Social Layer** · `meadow.grove.place`

A meadow is where the forest opens up. Sunlight reaches the ground. You can see the people around you clearly, without the dense canopy of algorithmic noise blocking the view.

Meadow is social media that remembers what "social" means. No public metrics breeding hierarchy. No viral mechanics rewarding the loudest voice. Just a chronological feed of people you chose to follow, with reactions that only the author can see. Encouragement without performance. Connection without competition.

---

## Forage
**Domain Discovery** · `forage.grove.place`

Before you can plant, you have to search. You walk the forest floor, looking for what you need—something that fits, something that's *available*, something worth bringing home.

Forage is an AI-powered domain hunting tool that turns weeks of frustrating searches into hours. Tell it about your project, your vibe, your budget—and it returns a curated list of available domains that actually fit. Finding the right name takes effort. Forage does the searching so you can focus on choosing.

---

## Foliage
**Theming System** · `foliage.grove.place`

Foliage is what you see when you look at a tree. The leaves, the color, the personality that changes with the seasons. No two canopies are quite the same.

Foliage is visual customization for your blog—from accent colors to full theme control. Pick a curated theme or build your own. Make it warm, make it bold, make it *yours*. Your foliage is how the world sees your corner of the grove.

---

## Heartwood
**Authentication** · `heartwood.grove.place`

Cut a tree open and you'll find the heartwood at the center—the densest, most durable part. It's what remains when everything else falls away. It's the authentic core.

Heartwood is centralized authentication for the Grove ecosystem. One identity, verified and protected, that works across every Grove property. Your heartwood is yours. It proves you are who you say you are.

---

## Cache
**Backup System** · *Internal service*

Squirrels cache acorns for winter. They bury what matters in safe places, trusting they can return when they need it.

Cache runs weekly automated backups of every Grove database to cold storage. Twelve weeks of history, always available, quietly preserved. You'll probably never think about it—and that's the point. When disaster strikes, Cache is already there, holding everything safe.

---

## Trove
**Library Book Discovery** · `trove.grove.place`

A trove is a collection of precious things, gathered and waiting to be discovered.

Point your camera at a library shelf. Trove identifies the books, cross-references your reading history and tastes, and tells you which ones are worth your time—with visual markers showing exactly where they sit on the shelf. No more decision paralysis. No more walking out empty-handed. Just treasures, found.

---

## Outpost
**Minecraft Server** · `mc.grove.place`

An outpost is where you gather at the edge of the wilderness. A place to rest, regroup, and adventure together.

Outpost is an on-demand Minecraft server for friends. It spins up when someone wants to play, shuts down when the world goes quiet, and costs almost nothing to run. No 24/7 hosting fees for a server that sits empty. Just a place that's there when you need it.

---

## Aria
**Music Curation** · `aria.grove.place`

An aria is a self-contained melody—a single voice carrying emotion through song.

Give Aria a song you love, and it builds a playlist of tracks that share the same musical DNA. Not just "similar artists" or genre tags, but actual sonic and emotional connections, with explanations for why each song belongs. Your aria becomes a chorus. One voice finds its kindred.

---

## Lattice
**Core Platform** · `npm: @autumnsgrove/lattice`

A lattice is the framework that supports growth. Vines climb it. Gardens are built around it. It's not the thing you see—it's the thing that holds everything else up.

Lattice is the npm package powering every Grove site. UI components, authentication utilities, markdown rendering, database patterns—all the infrastructure that makes building on Grove feel effortless. You don't admire a lattice. You build on it, and watch what grows.

**Vines** are a feature of Lattice: the widgets and content that fill your blog's gutters (the sidebar margins alongside your main content). Like vines climbing a trellis, they grow alongside your posts—related links, callouts, annotations, metadata. Gutter content that adds context without interrupting the flow.

---

## Rings
**Analytics** · *Integrated into admin dashboard*

Count the rings of a tree and you learn its story. Each ring records a season—growth in plenty, resilience through hardship, the quiet accumulation of years. Rings are internal. Private. You only see them when you look closely at your own tree.

Rings is analytics for writers, not marketers. No public view counts breeding anxiety. No leaderboards. No real-time dopamine hits. Just private insights about your own growth—who's reading, what resonates, how your garden is growing over time. Delayed by design, reflective by nature. Your rings are yours alone.

---

## Ivy
**Email** · `ivy.grove.place`

Ivy climbs the lattice. It's the living connection that grows along the framework, reaching out, intertwining, linking one point to another.

Ivy is email for Grove. Not a Gmail replacement—a focused, privacy-first mail client for your `@grove.place` address. Professional correspondence for your blog. A place where contact form submissions arrive as threads. Zero-knowledge encryption means we can't read your mail; it's yours alone. One address, chosen once, that's authentically you.

---

## Amber
**Storage Management** · `amber.grove.place`

Amber is fossilized tree resin—preserving moments in time, capturing life in suspended animation. It holds what matters, protecting it for centuries.

Amber is Grove's unified storage management system. Every file you upload—blog images, email attachments, profile pictures—is preserved in Amber, organized and accessible from one place. See what's using your space. Download and export your data. Clean up what you don't need. Buy more when you need it. Amber isn't trying to be Dropbox or Google Drive. It's the storage layer that already exists in Grove—made visible and manageable. Every paid user already has storage; Amber is how they understand and control it.

---

## Shade
**AI Content Protection** · `grove.place/shade`

Shade is the cool relief beneath the canopy. Protection from the harsh glare of exposure. It's where you rest, out of sight from those who would harvest without asking.

Shade is Grove's layered defense against AI crawlers, scrapers, and automated data harvesting. In a world where tech giants treat user content as training data to be extracted without consent, Shade is a quiet refusal. robots.txt directives, meta tags, rate limiting, WAF rules, and legal documentation, all working together so writers can write without worrying about becoming someone else's training data.

*In a forest full of harvesters, this grove stays shaded.*

---

## Trails
**Personal Roadmaps** · `username.grove.place/trail`

A trail is the path you're walking—the route you've chosen through the forest, marked by where you've been and where you're headed. No two trails are the same.

Trails lets Grove users share their own roadmaps with the world. Whether you're building a project, planning a content series, or just charting where your creative work is headed, Trails gives you a place to show the journey. Create waypoints marking milestones, group them into phases with custom names, and let visitors follow along as you make progress.

For those who want to dream bigger: Oak and Evergreen users can bring the full Grove aesthetic to their trails—seasonal themes, nature decorations, custom assets. Or keep it simple with a clean timeline. Your trail, your way.

**Templates available for:** Writers planning content series, developers building in public, musicians tracking album progress, restaurants showing seasonal menus, and more.

*The path becomes clear by walking it.*

---

## Vineyard
**Asset & Tool Showcase** · `*.grove.place/vineyard`

A vineyard is where vines are tended before they're ready—rows of growth, organized and visible, trained along the lattice. It's part nursery, part gallery. A place to see what's growing and understand how it all fits together.

Vineyard is the documentation and demo pattern for every Grove tool. Each product gets its own `/vineyard` route: `amber.grove.place/vineyard`, `ivy.grove.place/vineyard`, `foliage.grove.place/vineyard`. Inside, you'll find working demos where possible, visual mockups for what's coming, feature documentation, and the philosophy behind each tool. It's where you go to understand what something does before you use it—or to dream about what it will become.

Some vineyards showcase mature vines ready for harvest. Others tend young shoots still finding their shape. Both belong here. The vineyard doesn't hide what's unfinished—it celebrates the growing.

*Every vine starts somewhere.*

## A Note on Naming

These names share common ground: nature, shelter, things that grow. But none of them are *about* trees directly. They're about what happens in and around the forest. Where people gather (Meadow). What you search for and find (Forage). Where you find treasure (Trove). What holds everything together (Lattice).

The Grove is the place. These are the things you find there.
