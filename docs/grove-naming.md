# The Grove Naming System

> *A forest of voices. Every user is a tree in the grove.*

## The Philosophy

The internet used to be a place of personal expression. Somewhere along the way, we traded that for algorithms and engagement metrics. Grove is a return to something simpler—a place where people can plant their thoughts and watch them grow.

These names aren't just branding. They're the language of an ecosystem. Each one draws from the same soil: forests, growth, shelter, connection. Beneath the surface, roots intermingle. Trees share nutrients through mycorrhizal networks. The oldest trees nurture the saplings. 

This is how we build.

## Meadow
**The Social Layer** · `meadow.grove.place`

A meadow is where the forest opens up. Sunlight reaches the ground. You can see the people around you clearly, without the dense canopy of algorithmic noise blocking the view.

Meadow is social media that remembers what "social" means. No public metrics breeding hierarchy. No viral mechanics rewarding the loudest voice. Just a chronological feed of people you chose to follow, with reactions that only the author can see. Encouragement without performance. Connection without competition.

---

## Acorn
**Domain Discovery** · `acorn.grove.place`

Every oak was once an acorn. Every online presence starts with a name.

Acorn is an AI-powered domain hunting tool that turns weeks of frustrating searches into hours. Tell it about your project, your vibe, your budget—and it returns a curated list of available domains that actually fit. The seed you plant here becomes your entire digital presence. Choose it well; Acorn will help you find the right one.

---

## Heartwood
**Authentication** · `heartwood.grove.place`

Cut a tree open and you'll find the heartwood at the center—the densest, most durable part. It's what remains when everything else falls away. It's the authentic core.

Heartwood is centralized authentication for the Grove ecosystem. One identity, verified and protected, that works across every Grove property. Your heartwood is yours. It proves you are who you say you are.

---

## Cache
**Backup System** · *Internal service*

Squirrels cache acorns for winter. They bury what matters in safe places, trusting they can return when they need it.

Cache runs weekly automated backups of every Grove database to cold storage. Twelve weeks of history, always available, quietly preserved. You'll probably never think about it—and that's the point. When disaster strikes, Cache is already there, holding everything safe.

---

## Trove
**Library Book Discovery** · `trove.grove.place`

A trove is a collection of precious things, gathered and waiting to be discovered.

Point your camera at a library shelf. Trove identifies the books, cross-references your reading history and tastes, and tells you which ones are worth your time—with visual markers showing exactly where they sit on the shelf. No more decision paralysis. No more walking out empty-handed. Just treasures, found.

---

## Outpost
**Minecraft Server** · `mc.grove.place`

An outpost is where you gather at the edge of the wilderness. A place to rest, regroup, and adventure together.

Outpost is an on-demand Minecraft server for friends. It spins up when someone wants to play, shuts down when the world goes quiet, and costs almost nothing to run. No 24/7 hosting fees for a server that sits empty. Just a place that's there when you need it.

---

## Aria
**Music Curation** · `aria.grove.place`

An aria is a self-contained melody—a single voice carrying emotion through song.

Give Aria a song you love, and it builds a playlist of tracks that share the same musical DNA. Not just "similar artists" or genre tags, but actual sonic and emotional connections, with explanations for why each song belongs. Your aria becomes a chorus. One voice finds its kindred.

---

## Lattice
**Core Platform** · `npm: @autumnsgrove/lattice`

A lattice is the framework that supports growth. Vines climb it. Gardens are built around it. It's not the thing you see—it's the thing that holds everything else up.

Lattice is the npm package powering every Grove site. UI components, authentication utilities, markdown rendering, database patterns—all the infrastructure that makes building on Grove feel effortless. You don't admire a lattice. You build on it, and watch what grows.

---

## Rings
**Analytics** · *Integrated into admin dashboard*

Count the rings of a tree and you learn its story. Each ring records a season—growth in plenty, resilience through hardship, the quiet accumulation of years. Rings are internal. Private. You only see them when you look closely at your own tree.

Rings is analytics for writers, not marketers. No public view counts breeding anxiety. No leaderboards. No real-time dopamine hits. Just private insights about your own growth—who's reading, what resonates, how your garden is growing over time. Delayed by design, reflective by nature. Your rings are yours alone.

## Internal Names

For development, debugging, and internal documentation, the `Grove[Thing]` naming convention remains useful. It's explicit and functional—exactly what you want at 2am when something breaks.

| Public Name | Internal Name |
|-------------|---------------|
| Meadow | GroveSocial |
| Acorn | GroveDomainTool |
| Heartwood | GroveAuth |
| Cache | GroveBackups |
| Trove | TreasureTrove |
| Outpost | GroveMC |
| Aria | GroveMusic |
| Lattice | GroveEngine |
| Rings | GroveAnalytics |

## A Note on Naming

These names share common ground: nature, shelter, things that grow. But none of them are *about* trees directly. They're about what happens in and around the forest. Where people gather (Meadow). What becomes something greater (Acorn). Where you find treasure (Trove). What holds everything together (Lattice).

The Grove is the place. These are the things you find there.
