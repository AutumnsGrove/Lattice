# *The Journey*

From 'I Want a Blog' to SaaS Platform

*December 2025*

## The Timeline

**May 2025:** Graduated with IT/Cybersecurity degree

**November 2025:** Still unemployed, working retail, living in parents' basement

**Day 1:** "I want a domain"

**Day 2:** "I want to host images" → Discovered cdn.autumnsgrove.com

**Day 3:** "What if subdomains could scale?" → Wanted autumn.grove.place

**Days 4-6:** Manual domain searching (failed)

**Day 7:** Built AI domain-hunting agent, deployed during work shift

***Lunch break:*** Found grove.place for \$17. Instant tagline: "Get your place in the Grove"

**That afternoon:** Full project spec, GitHub repo, 25 commits

**Week 2:** Landing page live, multi-tenant architecture, component library

**Week 3:** First NPM package published (@autumnsgrove/groveengine v0.5.0)

## The Deeper Why

The timeline tells you what happened. It doesn't tell you why it happened so fast, or why it happened at all.

I wasn't just building a blogging platform. I was rebuilding everything I'd lost.

Six months before Day 1, I had a backyard. A hammock. A garden I'd tended for two years. A front porch where I watched robins dance at sunrise. Friends who'd come over just to exist together in the same space. My days had *texture*.

Then I lost all of it. Moved into my parents' basement. No windows. No garden. No sanctuary. My days went numb.

Grove came into existence as my life was sparking back to life. The forest on the landing page exists because I missed my forest. The security system is named after birds because I missed my birds. Wander mode exists because I finally have the freedom to just pick a direction and walk.

I'm building a grove for people who lost their groves.

## Current Stats (as of Dec 9, 2025)

- **20+ day coding streak**

- **~60 commits per day** across 8+ repositories

- First NPM package ever published

- 50+ UI components built

- 181 security tests passing

- 7 database migrations

- AI-powered domain search tool deployed

- CDN caching verified and working

## The Business Model

### Pricing Tiers

| **Tier**     |   **Price**    | **Storage** |    **Target**     |
|--------------|:--------------:|:-----------:|:-----------------:|
| Basic        |   \$12/month   |    5 GB     |     Hobbyists     |
| Professional |   \$25/month   |    20 GB    | Serious bloggers  |
| **Premium**  | **\$50/month** | **100 GB**  | **Professionals** |

### Domain Service (Premium Add-on)

AI-powered domain search that turns 2-week searches into 1-2 hours:

- **\$200 same-day** → credited as 4 months of Premium

- **\$100 for 3 days** → credited as 2 months of Premium

- **\$50 for 1 week** → credited as 1 month of Premium

*Setup fees aren't lost: they become subscription credit.*

## The Economics: Why This Works

### R2 Storage Costs

Cloudflare R2 with CDN caching means infrastructure costs are nearly zero:

|   **Users**   |  **R2 Cost**  | **Revenue** | **R2 as % Rev** |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|:---------------:|
|     1,000     |     ~\$59     |  \$15,200   |      0.39%      |
|    10,000     |    ~\$590     |  \$152,000  |      0.39%      |
| **1,000,000** | **~\$59,500** | **\$15.2M** |    **0.39%**    |

**R2 stays at ~0.4% of revenue regardless of scale. Bandwidth is always free.**

### Revenue Projections

Assuming 85% Basic, 10% Pro, 5% Premium:

- **50 users:** \$760/month, approaching current retail income

- **100 users:** \$1,520/month, exceeds current income

- **500 users:** \$7,600/month, financial stability

- **1,000 users:** \$15,200/month, life-changing

## What Made This Possible

Built in a framework (SvelteKit) never used before, in under 3 weeks:

- AI coding agents (Claude Code, Kilo Code)

- Cloudflare's generous free tier

- Vision-first development (know WHAT, let AI handle HOW)

- Relentless execution (60 commits/day, 20-day streak)

- Building in public (accountability + portfolio)

This isn't "AI replacing developers." It's ***AI creating developers***. The barrier between idea and implementation collapsed. The work shifted from fighting syntax to building vision.

## Philosophy: Build With Integrity

Could easily lock customers in with data traps. Could be predatory with pricing. Could hide costs. Could optimize for engagement over wellbeing.

**Instead:** Be genuine. Be honest. Be transparent. Build infrastructure that *helps* people.

The money comes from providing value, not exploitation. The community comes from genuine connection, not gamified engagement. The growth comes from people who actually want what you're building.

This isn't just business philosophy. It's personal.

I know what it feels like to lose a sanctuary. I know what numb days feel like. I know what it means to finally find texture again. Grove exists because I needed it to exist, and I'm building it the way I wish every platform was built: with care, with honesty, with the understanding that the people using it are real humans looking for a place to belong.

*All because I wanted a blog.*

*All because I missed my backyard.*
