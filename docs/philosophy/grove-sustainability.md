# How Grove Lasts: A Sustainability Promise

> *Some trees outlive the people who planted them.*

When Grove promises your words can live for 100 years, that's not marketing. It's a commitment backed by financial structure, not just good intentions. Here's how it works.

## The Honest Reality

Grove is built by one person. Right now, if this doesn't work, I'm going to go work at Waffle House. That's not self-deprecation—it's honesty. I'm putting everything into this because I believe in what we're building.

But here's the thing: I also know I won't live 100 years.

So how can I promise your words will?

## The Three Phases

### Phase 1: Getting Started (0–1,000 users)

In the early days, Grove is simple:

- Server costs come first (always)
- What's left goes to keeping the creator alive
- Margins hover near zero—maybe 5%

This phase is about survival. Building something real. Proving the model works.

### Phase 2: Finding Stability (1,000–5,000 users)

Once Grove has a real community:

- I start taking a salary (not "all the profits")
- Grove becomes its own entity—not just Autumn's side project
- Revenue beyond salary and costs goes into **The Reserve**

This is the transition from "person with a project" to "sustainable organization."

### Phase 3: Building Legacy (5,000+ users)

This is where the 100-year promise becomes real:

- Grove holds its own assets
- The Reserve grows
- The organization can outlive its founder

At scale, with $500,000 in reserve, Grove could run for 50+ years on interest alone—even with no new subscribers.

## Why This Actually Works

### The Math Is On Our Side

Grove runs on Cloudflare infrastructure. Here's what that means:

| Service | Cost at 1,000 users | Cost at 10,000 users |
|---------|--------------------:|---------------------:|
| Workers | ~$5/month | ~$5/month |
| D1 (Database) | ~$0.50/month | ~$5/month |
| R2 (Storage) | ~$2/month | ~$20/month |
| KV | ~$0/month | ~$0.50/month |
| **Total infrastructure** | **~$8/month** | **~$31/month** |

*Note: These are infrastructure costs only. Additional operational costs include payment processing (~3% of revenue via Stripe), email service (~$3/month), domain registration for Evergreen users, and support tools. Total operational overhead runs 5-10% of revenue—still dramatically lower than typical SaaS.*

At 1,000 users paying an average of $11/month, that's $11,000/month in revenue against ~$800-1,100/month in total costs (infrastructure + operations).

The margins aren't 10%. They're 90%+.

This isn't normal. Most SaaS products spend 30-50% of revenue on infrastructure. Grove's architecture means almost every dollar can go toward sustainability, not servers.

### The Scaling Secret

Cloudflare's pricing is nearly flat at our scale. Whether we have 1,000 or 10,000 users, the infrastructure cost barely moves. This means:

- More users = more reserve, not more overhead
- Growth compounds into stability
- The 100-year promise gets *more* achievable over time, not less

## The Reserve

Once Grove reaches stability, excess revenue goes into The Reserve—a fund specifically for long-term sustainability.

### What The Reserve Does

1. **Covers emergencies**: If subscriptions drop suddenly, The Reserve keeps servers running
2. **Funds transitions**: If I can't run Grove anymore, The Reserve funds the handoff
3. **Guarantees Centennial**: The Reserve is what makes the 100-year promise real

### How The Reserve Grows

| Monthly Revenue | After Salary & Costs | Annual Reserve Growth |
|----------------:|---------------------:|----------------------:|
| $5,000 | ~$2,000 | ~$24,000 |
| $10,000 | ~$5,000 | ~$60,000 |
| $25,000 | ~$15,000 | ~$180,000 |

At $25,000/month revenue with ~2,000 users, The Reserve could hit $500,000 in under 3 years.

### What $500,000 Means

With $500,000 in reserve, earning 4% annually in a simple index fund:

- **Annual return**: $20,000
- **Annual infrastructure costs**: ~$500
- **Years of runway with zero revenue**: 50+ years

That's not a promise. That's math.

### Structure & Governance

The Reserve isn't just a concept—it needs real structure:

- **Held separately**: Dedicated high-yield savings or index fund account, separate from operating funds
- **Protected from creditors**: Once Grove incorporates, The Reserve will be structured to survive business disputes
- **Withdrawal triggers**: Only used for emergencies (sudden revenue drop >50%), succession transitions, or Centennial obligations
- **Transparency**: Annual public reporting on Reserve status (growing/stable/drawing)

During Phase 1 (current), The Reserve is a line item I'm building toward. By Phase 2, it becomes a legally distinct fund.

## Succession Planning

I won't live forever. Neither will Grove in its current form. But your words can.

### The Succession Plan

1. **Legal structure**: Grove is currently a sole proprietorship. Target: LLC or benefit corporation formation by end of Phase 1 (~500 users), with clear succession rules and Reserve protection built in from day one.
2. **Documentation**: Everything about running Grove is documented—infrastructure, processes, contacts, credentials. A successor could take over with the docs alone.
3. **Designated successors**: Trusted people who can take over, identified before Phase 2.
4. **Worst-case protocol**: If no successor available, The Reserve funds a managed wind-down:
   - Minimum 3 years notice to all users
   - Full data export support (API + bulk download)
   - Static HTML archives uploaded to Internet Archive
   - Graceful transition, not sudden shutdown

### What "Succession" Looks Like

- **Best case**: Someone I trust continues growing Grove
- **Good case**: A small team maintains Grove as-is
- **Okay case**: Grove freezes but stays online (Centennial sites remain accessible)
- **Worst case**: Years-long managed transition to static archives

Even the worst case honors the Centennial promise.

## Transparency

This document isn't locked away in an investor deck. It's public. You can read it. You can hold me to it.

I'll update this document every January with:

- Current user count (ranges, not exact)
- Reserve status (growing/stable/drawing)
- Infrastructure costs (actual, not projected)
- Any changes to the sustainability plan

Updates will be announced on the Grove blog and emailed to Centennial members. This document's edit history is public on GitHub.

No surprises. No hidden pivots. Just honesty about how we're doing.

## Why This Matters

Most platforms make promises they can't keep. "We'll never sell your data." "We're not going anywhere." Then the VC funding dries up, the acqui-hire happens, and your content becomes someone else's problem.

Grove is different because:

1. **No VC funding** = No pressure to exit
2. **Extreme margins** = Sustainability is achievable
3. **The Reserve** = A structural guarantee, not just words
4. **Transparency** = You can see if we're on track

The 100-year promise isn't naive optimism. It's engineering. Financial engineering, legal engineering, organizational engineering—all designed so your words outlive me.

---

## The Covenant

When you earn Centennial status, you're not just getting a feature. You're entering into a covenant:

**Your words matter enough to me that I will build an organization capable of preserving them for a century.**

That's what your support means. That's what we're building together.
