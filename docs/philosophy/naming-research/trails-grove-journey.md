# A Journey Through the Grove

*Scratchpad for exploring the personal roadmaps name*

## The Scene

```
                                    ☀️

```

## Walking Through...

I enter the grove. The **Lattice** holds everything up—
the invisible structure beneath.

I walk past **Meadow** where people gather,
through **Shade** where my words are protected,
past the **Pantry** where provisions are kept.

I find my tree—my blog, my corner of the forest.
My **Foliage** is how others see me.
My **Rings** record my quiet growth.
My **Heartwood** is my verified core.

Now I want to share where I'm going.
Not just what I've written.
Where I'm HEADED.

What am I looking for?

---

## What IS a Personal Roadmap?

Let me think about what this thing actually IS.

A roadmap is:
- A plan for where you're going
- Visible to others (building in public)
- Made of milestones (waypoints along the way)
- Forward-looking (the future!)
- Intentional (you CHOSE this path)

It's NOT:
- Just where you've been (that's history)
- Wandering (that's exploration)
- Private (this is public, shared)
- Accidental (this is deliberate)

---

## The Problem with "Trails"

Currently called "Trails" internally. Let me examine this.

```
    A TRAIL

    ~~~~~~~~ start ~~~~~~~
         ↓
         •     ← you walked here
         ↓
         •     ← and here
         ↓
         •     ← and here
         ↓
    [YOU ARE HERE]
         ↓
         ?     ← where does trail go?
         ?
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

A trail is:
- Formed BY walking (descriptive)
- Shows where you've BEEN
- Can be followed by others
- Natural, organic
- Historical record

But wait. A roadmap is:
- Made BEFORE walking (prescriptive)
- Shows where you're GOING
- Intentionally planned
- Future-oriented

**Does "trail" capture planning? Does it capture the future?**

Hmm. When I think "trail," I think of a path worn into the earth
by feet that have already passed. The trail exists because
someone already walked it.

But a roadmap exists BEFORE the journey.
It's a promise. A declaration. "This is where I'm headed."

---

## What IS a roadmap in forest terms?

In a real forest, what shows where you're GOING to walk?

- A map (too literal)
- Blazes on trees (marking the intended route)
- A compass heading (direction of travel)
- Trail markers (waypoints ahead)

Wait. What about BLAZING a trail?

```
    BLAZING A TRAIL

    [YOU ARE HERE]
         ↓
         ⊕  ← blaze (I plan to go here)
         ↓
         ⊕  ← blaze (then here)
         ↓
         ⊕  ← blaze (then here)
         ↓
         ★  ← destination
```

A blaze is a mark on a tree showing WHERE TO GO.
It's forward-looking. Intentional. Public.

"Blaze" as a name?

---

## Let Me List What This Feature Does

The personal roadmaps feature lets you:
1. Create phases (groups of milestones)
2. Add waypoints (individual milestones)
3. Track progress (mark things complete)
4. Share publicly (others can follow along)
5. Use templates (writer, developer, musician, etc.)
6. Show your journey to the world

It's... a public declaration of intent.
"Here's where I'm going. Watch me get there."

---

## Forest Metaphors for "Where You're Going"

**Direction/Navigation:**
- Compass - points the way
- Bearing - your heading
- Course - the route you've set
- Heading - where you're pointed

**Paths/Routes:**
- Trail - where you've walked (past-focused)
- Path - could be past or future
- Route - planned journey
- Way - the road ahead

**Markers/Signs:**
- Blaze - marks on trees showing direction
- Cairn - stacked stones marking the way
- Waypoint - a specific point along the journey
- Marker - indicator of progress

**The Act of Traveling:**
- Journey - the act of going somewhere
- Trek - a long, purposeful trip
- Expedition - planned adventure
- Quest - journey with purpose

**Planning:**
- Survey - mapping the terrain ahead
- Chart - planning the course
- Scout - looking ahead

---

## Let Me Walk This Through

I'm a user. I want to share my plans with the world.

```
    My tree (blog) in the grove
            |
            |
            v
    ╭───────────────────╮
    │  MY ROADMAP       │
    │                   │
    │  Phase 1: Launch  │
    │    • Write docs   │  ← done!
    │    • Build MVP    │  ← in progress
    │    • Get feedback │  ← upcoming
    │                   │
    │  Phase 2: Grow    │
    │    • Add features │
    │    • Find users   │
    │                   │
    ╰───────────────────╯
```

What IS this thing I'm showing the world?

It's... my intended path through the forest.
It's... the trail I'm GOING to walk.
It's... the way I've charted.

---

## Exploring "Blaze"

**Blaze** - marks on trees showing the route ahead

In the real world:
- Trail blazers leave marks for others to follow
- A blaze is a deliberate marking
- It says "this is the way"
- It's forward-looking

"Your blaze" - your planned path through the forest.

```
    🌲  ⊕  🌲      ⊕ = blaze marks
        |
    🌲  ⊕  🌲      the route you're
        |          taking through
    🌲  ⊕  🌲      the grove
        |
       ★ destination
```

But "blaze" also means fire... and speed ("blazing fast").
Could be confusing.

---

## Exploring "Cairn"

**Cairn** - stacked stones marking the way

Hikers stack stones at key points:
- Where the path is unclear
- At summits/achievements
- As markers for others to follow

A cairn is:
- Intentionally built
- A marker of progress
- Something others can see
- Made of small pieces stacked up

"Your cairn" - the stack of milestones you're building.

```
         ★     ← ultimate goal
        ▓▓▓
       ▓▓▓▓▓   ← stacking up
      ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓
     ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ← milestones
    ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓
    ═══════════
       base
```

Hmm. Cairn is more about stacking achievements
than about showing a PATH forward.

---

## Exploring "Route"

**Route** - the planned path from here to there

A route is:
- Chosen deliberately
- Known before walking
- Can be shared with others
- Has a start and end

"Your route" - the way you plan to get there.

But "route" feels very... geographic? Technical?
Not as warm as other Grove names.

---

## Exploring "Trek"

**Trek** - a long, purposeful journey

A trek is:
- Intentional
- Takes time
- Has stages
- Meaningful

"Your trek" - the journey you're on.

Trek feels... active? Like the act of traveling,
not the plan for traveling.

---

## Let Me Think About What FEELING This Should Evoke

When someone visits username.grove.place/trail, they should feel:

- Invited into someone's plans
- Like they're following along on a journey
- Inspired by the person's ambition
- Connected to the progress being made

It's like... being let into someone's hopes?
Their vision for where they're going?

---

## What About "Way"?

**Way** - the path forward

"The Way" has spiritual connotations (Taoism, etc.)
But "your way" could be nice.

"My way through the grove"
"The way I'm walking"

Way.grove.place? Hmm.

---

## Stepping Back: Is Trail Actually Right?

Let me reconsider "Trails."

Arguments FOR trails:
- A trail CAN be forward-looking (if you're following one)
- "Blaze a trail" is a phrase (creating a new path)
- Trail implies visibility (others can follow)
- Trail implies direction (going somewhere)
- The trail metaphor works: waypoints, phases, progress

Arguments AGAINST trails:
- Trails are typically formed by past walking
- "Trail" doesn't inherently suggest planning
- A trail is descriptive, not prescriptive

But wait...

What if the user is BLAZING a trail?
Not following one—CREATING one?

```
    BLAZING YOUR TRAIL

    You're not following a path someone else made.
    You're marking the way for the first time.

    Each waypoint is a blaze mark you leave.
    Others watch you cut through the undergrowth.
    The trail forms as you walk—
    but you PLANNED where you'd walk.
```

In this framing, "trail" isn't about where you've been—
it's about the path you're CREATING as you go.
Planned, but made real through action.

---

## The Truth About Roadmaps

Actually, thinking about it more...

A roadmap isn't JUST a plan. It's:
- A living document
- Updated as you make progress
- Reflects both plan AND reality
- Shows what's done AND what's ahead

The best roadmaps show:
- Where you've been (completed milestones)
- Where you are (current progress)
- Where you're going (upcoming milestones)

A trail does ALL of this:
- The worn path (where you've been)
- Your current position (where you are)
- The blazes ahead (where you're going)

---

## Visualizing It

```
    THE TRAIL

    ═══════ [completed] ═══════
             ↓
             • milestone (done)
             ↓
             • milestone (done)
             ↓
    ─ ─ ─ [YOU ARE HERE] ─ ─ ─
             ↓
             ○ milestone (planned)
             ↓
             ○ milestone (planned)
             ↓
    ═══════ [destination] ══════
             ★
```

The trail shows the WHOLE journey.
Past. Present. Future.

It's a path you're walking AND planning.
Both descriptive AND prescriptive.

---

## Testing the Tagline

"Trails is where you _______________."

- "Trails is where you share your journey."
- "Trails is where you show the path you're walking."
- "Trails is where you blaze a trail for others to follow."
- "Trails is the path you're walking—past, present, future."

Actually... that last one is interesting.

*"The path becomes clear by walking it."*

That's already the tagline in grove-naming.md!
And it captures something important:
The plan and the action are intertwined.
You plan, then walk. The trail emerges.

---

## Comparing Alternatives One More Time

| Name | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| **Trail** | Warm, familiar, implies journey | Could feel past-focused |
| **Blaze** | Forward-looking, deliberate | Also means fire, speed |
| **Route** | Clearly planned | Technical, cold |
| **Trek** | Active, purposeful | About traveling, not planning |
| **Way** | Simple, spiritual | Too vague, generic |
| **Cairn** | Achievement-focused | About stacking, not pathing |

---

## What About the Sub-Components?

Currently the feature has:
- **Waypoints** - individual milestones
- **Phases** - groups of waypoints

Waypoints already fit perfectly:
A waypoint is literally a point along the way.
Used in navigation. Future-oriented. Perfect.

Phases work too:
Phases of a journey. Stages of the trip.

So the naming internally is consistent:
- Trail = the overall path
- Phases = stages of the trail
- Waypoints = markers along each phase

---

## My Gut Check

Sitting here in the grove, thinking about this...

When I say "my trail," I think:
- My personal path through life/work/creativity
- Where I'm going
- The journey I'm on
- Something I'm actively walking

It's intimate. Personal. "My trail."

When I say "my roadmap," I think:
- A plan document
- Something corporate
- Formal, structured
- Less personal

"Trail" is warmer. More Grove.

---

## The Realization

I came into this questioning whether "Trails" is right.
Thinking maybe we need something more future-focused.

But actually...

A trail IS about the future—when you're the one walking it.
A trail IS about planning—when you're blazing it.
A trail IS visible—others can follow along.
A trail IS personal—it's YOUR path through the forest.

The word "trail" doesn't need to mean "where you've been."
It can mean "the path you're walking and will walk."

---

## Final Thoughts

**Do we need to change the name?**

I don't think so.

"Trails" captures:
- The personal nature (your trail, not the highway)
- The journey aspect (you're going somewhere)
- The visibility (trails can be followed)
- The progress (you walk the trail over time)
- The Grove aesthetic (very forest, very nature)

The key insight: A trail is both where you've been AND where you're going.
It's the full picture of a journey.
That's exactly what a personal roadmap is.

---

## The Entry (Already Written)

Looking back at grove-naming.md, the entry for Trails reads:

> **Trails**
> **Personal Roadmaps** · `username.grove.place/trail`
>
> A trail is the path you're walking: the route you've chosen through
> the forest, marked by where you've been and where you're headed.
> No two trails are the same.
>
> *The path becomes clear by walking it.*

That captures it. The name is right.

---

## But Wait—One More Walk

Let me make sure I'm not missing something.
Let me walk through the grove one more time.

I'm a writer. I want to share my plans for my novel series.
I go to my blog. I click on... "Trail"?

```
    📖 autumn.grove.place

    [Blog] [About] [Trail]
                     ↑
                     ?
```

"Trail" as a nav item. Does it make sense?

- "My Trail" - yes, that works
- "View my trail" - works
- "Follow my trail" - works
- "See where I'm headed" - works

What about "My Journey"?
Hmm. Journey is the ACT of traveling.
Trail is the PATH of traveling.

You walk a trail. You take a journey.
The trail is the thing you share.
The journey is what you do.

Trail = the artifact, the shareable thing.
Journey = the experience, the personal process.

Yes. Trail is right.

---

## Alternative Exploration: "March"

Just to be thorough, what about "March"?

A march is:
- A long, purposeful walk
- Often in a direction
- With purpose

"My march toward the goal"

But march feels military. Not cozy.

---

## Alternative Exploration: "Course"

"My course through the grove"

A course is:
- A direction of movement
- A planned route
- Academic connotation too

"Stay the course"

But course is cold. Technical.

---

## Conclusion

After walking through the grove, considering alternatives,
and testing the metaphor from multiple angles...

**"Trails" is the right name.**

It's:
- Personal (your trail)
- Directional (going somewhere)
- Visible (others can follow)
- Historical AND future-oriented (past, present, future)
- Warm and welcoming (very Grove)
- Consistent with sub-components (waypoints, phases)

The tagline captures it perfectly:
*"The path becomes clear by walking it."*

A trail isn't just where you've been.
It's where you're going.
It's the whole journey, shared with the world.

---

## Postscript: What I Learned

Coming into this, I thought "trails" might be too past-focused.
But walking through the metaphor, I realized:

The person sharing a trail is the one WALKING it.
They're not looking back at footprints.
They're marking the way forward.
They're blazing a trail.

The beauty of "trail" is that it's both:
- A record of the journey (trust—you can see progress)
- A map of what's ahead (hope—you can see intentions)

That duality is exactly what personal roadmaps need.
Not just a plan (cold). Not just history (backward).
A living path being walked in real time.

*Your trail. Your journey. Shared with the grove.*
