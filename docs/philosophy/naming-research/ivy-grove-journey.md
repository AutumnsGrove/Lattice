# A Journey Through the Grove: Private Messages

*Scratchpad for finding the right name for the privacy-first email client*

---

## The Question

We have "Ivy" for email. But is it *right*?

Ivy = climbing plant that grows along frameworks, connecting points.

But this email service isn't just about *connection*. Its soul is:
- **Zero-knowledge encryption** - Grove literally cannot read your mail
- **Privacy as the foundation** - not an add-on, the entire point
- **Your words, sealed away**

Does a climbing, connecting vine capture the essence of *sealed, private, encrypted* messages?

---

## The Scene

```
                                    .  *  .
                                 .    *    .
                               .   *  *  *   .
                              .  *  STARS  *  .
                             . * * * * * * * * .

```

---

## Walking Through...

I enter the grove. I find my tree—my blog, my home.

I can see other trees. I wave across the Meadow.
My Foliage is how they see me—colors, style, presence.
My Rings record my private growth—views, readers, time.

But now I need to COMMUNICATE.
Not publicly in Meadow. Not comments in Reeds.
Privately. Directly. Sealed.

Someone wants to reach me—a reader, a collaborator.
Or I need to reach them.

The message travels... where?

---

## What IS Email in This Forest?

In the physical world, private messages have forms:

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                                 │
    │   📜 LETTER         sealed, addressed,         │
    │      in envelope    travels through system      │
    │                                                 │
    │   🕊️ CARRIER BIRD   a messenger, carries       │
    │                     words between points        │
    │                                                 │
    │   🔐 LOCKED BOX     contents hidden from        │
    │                     everyone except recipient   │
    │                                                 │
    │   💌 WAX SEAL       proof of authenticity,      │
    │                     shows if tampered           │
    │                                                 │
    │   🌿 IVY            connecting vine...          │
    │                     but where's the privacy?    │
    │                                                 │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Ivy is about CONNECTION. But this service is about
**PRIVACY-FIRST** connection. The encryption is the point.

---

## The Current "Ivy" Metaphor

From grove-naming.md:
> "Ivy climbs the lattice. It's the living connection that grows along
> the framework, reaching out, intertwining, linking one point to another."

Ivy emphasizes:
- Climbing (growing along structure)
- Connecting (linking points)
- Living threads (organic connection)

But Ivy is VISIBLE. You can see ivy climbing a wall.
Private email is NOT visible. It's sealed. Hidden. Protected.

**The metaphor might be incomplete.**

---

## What Does Zero-Knowledge Mean in Forest Terms?

Zero-knowledge encryption means:
- Grove carries your message but CANNOT READ IT
- Only sender and recipient have the key
- The carrier is blind to the contents

```
    Your message in transit:

    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                          │
    │     [YOU]                   [THEM]       │
    │       |                        |         │
    │       |    ╔═══════════╗      |         │
    │       └───>║ ENCRYPTED ║──────>         │
    │            ║  MESSAGE  ║                 │

    │                 |                        │
    │            GROVE SEES:                   │

    │            (literally nothing)           │
    │                                          │
    └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

In nature, what carries something without seeing inside?

---

## Things That Carry Without Seeing

**A sealed seedpod** - carries life, doesn't reveal it
**Amber** - but that's taken (storage)
**A burr** - attaches and travels, contents unknown
**Tree bark** - protects what's inside
**A cocoon** - transformation happens invisibly
**A shell** - hard exterior, hidden interior
**A hollow in a tree** - secret space for hidden things

---

## The Hollow (Again)

I keep coming back to this.

A hollow in a tree:
- Where creatures nest in secret
- Where you'd leave a hidden message
- Protected space within the tree
- Only those who know can find it
- The tree itself doesn't "know" what's inside

```
         🌲
        / | \
       /  |  \
      / ╭───╮ \
     /  │   │  \     <-- The hollow
    /   │ ? │   \        Private space
   /    ╰───╯    \       Hidden within
  /      | |      \
 /       | |       \
════════════════════════
```

**Hollow.grove.place**

"Leave your message in the hollow."

But... "hollow" also means empty. Void.
That's a bad connotation for communication.

---

## What About Birds?

Messages carried by birds have a long history.
Carrier pigeons. Ravens in fantasy. Owls in Harry Potter.

In the forest:
- **Dove** - peace, messages, gentle
- **Wren** - small, moves through underbrush unseen
- **Owl** - wise, sees in darkness, silent
- **Sparrow** - common, everywhere, unnoticed
- **Finch** - small, darting, quick

A bird carries a message in its beak.
It doesn't read what it carries.
It simply flies from sender to recipient.

```
         .  .
        (\  /)
         \\//
          \/    <-- carries message
        /|  |\
       / |  | \
          ||
```

**Wren** - "Send a wren"
**Dove** - "Send a dove"

Wren is interesting:
- Small, unassuming
- Moves through dense brush unnoticed
- Quick and direct
- Fiercely private (they hide in thickets)

---

## Wren

```
    ╭─────────────────────────────────────────────╮
    │                                             │
    │   WREN - tiny bird that moves unseen        │
    │                                             │
    │   - Hides in thickets (privacy)             │
    │   - Quick, darting movements (fast)         │
    │   - Loud voice for its size (powerful)      │
    │   - Nests in hidden places (secure)         │
    │   - Carries material back and forth         │
    │                                             │
    ╰─────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Wren.grove.place

"Send a wren to reach me."

The tagline test:
> "Wren is where your private messages live."

Hmm. It works, but is it *email*? Or more like DMs?

---

## Let Me Step Back: What IS This Service?

From the description:
- Zero-knowledge email for your @grove.place address
- Client-side encryption - Grove can't read your mail
- Threaded conversations, rich text, attachments
- Contact form submissions arrive as threads
- Professional correspondence for your blog

This is EMAIL. Real email. But private.
It's not DMs. Not social messaging.
It's the professional inbox for your blog.

So it needs to feel like:
- A mailbox (you check your mail)
- A correspondence system (back and forth threads)
- Something addressed (to your @grove.place)
- Something sealed (encrypted)

---

## Mailbox in the Forest?

What's a mailbox in a forest?

- A post by the path (but that's public-facing)
- A slot in a door (too architectural)
- A marked stone where messages are left (dead drop)
- A nesting box where birds bring messages

Wait.

A **nesting box**.

You put up a box. Birds bring things to it.
You check what's arrived.
It's attached to your tree.

---

## But Nook is Taken

Nook is private video sharing.
"A tucked-away corner."

So "nesting box" or similar concepts might overlap.

---

## The Sealed Message Problem

Let me focus on what makes this DIFFERENT from regular email:
**The seal. The encryption. The privacy.**

What in nature SEALS things?

- Resin → becomes Amber (taken)
- A cocoon → sealed transformation
- A shell → sealed protection
- A seed coat → sealed life
- Tree bark → sealed protection
- A wasp building a cell → sealed

**Sealed with something natural.**

---

## Resin and Sap

Tree sap becomes resin becomes amber.
Sap seals wounds. Protects the tree.
Resin traps and preserves.

What about **Resin**?

Resin.grove.place

"Your messages, sealed in resin."

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                         │
    │    ╭───────────────╮                   │
    │    │ YOUR MESSAGE  │                   │
    │    │               │ ← sealed in       │
    │    │  [encrypted]  │   golden resin    │
    │    │               │   only you can    │
    │    ╰───────────────╯   crack open      │
    │                                         │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

But Amber is already storage/preservation.
Resin is too similar? Or complementary?

Amber = long-term storage (fossilized resin)
Resin = fresh seal (active protection)

Actually... there's something here.
Resin is ACTIVE. Amber is PRESERVED.

---

## Let Me Test "Resin"

**Resin**
**Private Email** - `resin.grove.place`

Resin is what a tree produces to seal and protect itself.
When bark is cut, sap flows and hardens into resin—
a natural seal that keeps the vulnerable interior safe.

Resin is email sealed at the source. Your messages
wrapped in encryption before they ever leave your hands,
protected all the way to their destination. Grove carries
them but cannot see inside. Client-side encryption means
your correspondence is sealed in resin only you can crack open.

*Sealed at the source. Safe in transit.*

---

## Testing the Tagline

> "Resin is where your private messages live."

> "Resin is the seal on your words."

> "Resin is your encrypted inbox."

Hmm. "Resin" is a substance, not a place.
You don't GO to resin. You SEAL WITH resin.

That's awkward for "check your resin" (check your mail).

---

## What About the ACT of Sealing?

**Seal** - too generic
**Wax** - wax seal, but very specific
**Clasp** - closing something
**Latch** - securing

Or the CONTAINER that's sealed:

**Vessel** - something that holds
**Cache** - hidden store (but also tech term)
**Coffer** - locked box
**Casket** - (no, death)

---

## Coming Back to the Bird

What if the bird ISN'T about carrying?
What if it's about the ARRIVAL?

You don't send a dove. A dove ARRIVES.
You don't check your wren. Wrens COME TO YOU.

In the grove, messages arrive like birds.
They perch. You receive them.

**Perch** - where birds land

Perch.grove.place

"Check your perch."
"A message landed on your perch."

```
    Your tree in the grove:

              🌿
             /|\
            / | \
           /  |  \
        ──────────────  ← THE PERCH
         /   |    \        (messages land here)
        /    |     \
       🌲    |      🌲
             |
```

But "perch" is also a fish. Confusing.

---

## What About the Action of Arrival?

When something private arrives:
- It lands
- It's delivered
- It alights
- It comes to rest

**Alight** - to come down and settle

"A message alighted on your tree."

Alight.grove.place

Actually... "alight" also means "on fire" or "illuminated."
Double meaning could be interesting or confusing.

---

## Taking Stock: The Core Tension

IVY emphasizes: Connection, climbing, linking
THE SERVICE emphasizes: Privacy, encryption, sealed

These aren't opposites, but they're different emphases.

Can Ivy encompass privacy?
Ivy is a living thing—does it seal? Does it protect?

Actually... ivy can COVER things. Hide them.
Ivy growing over a wall conceals what's behind.
Ivy covering a ruin hides what was there.

```
    ╔═══════════════════════════════════════╗
    ║                                       ║
    ║    BEFORE           AFTER             ║
    ║                                       ║
    ║    🏚️ exposed      🌿🌿🌿 hidden     ║
    ║    |  |           🌿 🏠 🌿           ║
    ║    |  |           🌿🌿🌿🌿           ║
    ║                                       ║
    ║    Ivy doesn't just connect—          ║
    ║    it COVERS. It CONCEALS.            ║
    ║                                       ║
    ╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Wait. This reframes "Ivy" entirely.

Ivy isn't just about climbing and connecting.
Ivy also COVERS. CONCEALS. PROTECTS.

An ivy-covered wall hides what's behind it.
Ivy growing over something makes it private.

---

## Ivy as Concealment

In the original description:
> "Ivy climbs the lattice... reaching out, intertwining,
> linking one point to another."

But ivy's OTHER property is covering.
The privacy of ivy-covered walls.
The hiddenness of ivy-wrapped structures.

What if Ivy's metaphor is BOTH:
- Connection (the climbing, linking)
- Concealment (the covering, hiding)

The message travels along the ivy.
But the ivy COVERS the message as it goes.
Wrapped in leaves. Hidden from view.

```
    [YOU] ═══════════════════════════ [THEM]
              wrapped in ivy
          🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿

    The connection exists.
    But what travels along it is hidden.
```

---

## The Dual Nature of Ivy

IVY = Connection + Concealment

Connection: "Ivy climbs the lattice, linking points"
Concealment: "Ivy covers and hides what it touches"

For encrypted email, both are true:
- The message CONNECTS sender and recipient
- The message is CONCEALED from everyone else

**Maybe Ivy was right all along—we just needed to see the full metaphor.**

---

## Rewriting the Ivy Entry

Let me try:

## Ivy
**Private Email** - `ivy.grove.place`

Ivy climbs the lattice, linking point to point, tree to tree.
But ivy also conceals. What it covers, it hides.
An ivy-wrapped message travels the network
visible only to those it connects.

Ivy is encrypted email for your @grove.place address.
Not a Gmail replacement—a focused inbox for your blog's
correspondence. Contact forms arrive as threads.
Professional conversations stay organized.
Zero-knowledge encryption means Grove carries your
messages but cannot read them. The ivy covers
what travels along its vines.

*Connected and concealed.*

---

## But Let Me Keep Exploring...

The ivy reframe is compelling. But I should test alternatives.

What ELSE in nature connects while concealing?

**Roots/mycelium** - connect underground, invisible
(But Mycelium is taken for MCP)

**Underground streams** - water flows hidden
**Tunnels** - paths that can't be seen
**Burrows** - connected, hidden passages

What about **Burrow**?

Burrow.grove.place

"Messages travel through the burrow."

A burrow is:
- Underground (hidden)
- A network of passages (connected)
- Safe from predators (protected)
- Only known to its inhabitants (private)

But burrows feel... cramped? Rodent-like?
Not the warm, growth-oriented grove vibe.

---

## Thread and Weaving

Email has THREADS. Conversations.
What about weaving metaphors?

**Thread** - too generic/tech
**Weave** - the act of connecting threads
**Weft** - the threads that cross
**Loom** - where weaving happens

In the forest:
- Spider silk (too creepy)
- Bird nests woven from grass
- Woven bark

**Nest** - woven, protected, private

Nest.grove.place

A nest is:
- Carefully constructed
- Woven from natural materials
- Protected, hidden, safe
- Where important things are kept
- Unique to each builder

"Check your nest."
"A message in your nest."

```
    Your tree in the grove:

              🌿
             /|\
            / | \
           / ╭─╮ \
          / │ ○ │  \   <-- Your nest
         /  ╰───╯   \      (inbox)
        /     |      \
       🌲     |       🌲
              |
```

This is interesting.

A nest is where birds bring things.
Where precious things are kept safe.
Woven, natural, personal.

---

## Testing "Nest"

**Nest**
**Private Email** - `nest.grove.place`

A nest is woven from the forest itself—twigs, grass,
soft things gathered and shaped into something safe.
It's where precious things are kept. Where messages land.
Where you return to find what's been left for you.

Nest is encrypted email for your @grove.place address.
Your inbox, woven into your corner of the grove.
Messages arrive in threads, conversations branch
naturally, attachments are gathered in.
Zero-knowledge encryption means only you can
see what's inside your nest.

*Where your messages come home.*

---

## Ivy vs Nest

| Aspect | Ivy | Nest |
|--------|-----|------|
| Connection | Strong (climbing, linking) | Moderate (things arrive) |
| Privacy | Moderate (covering) | Strong (hidden, protected) |
| Container | No (ivy is the conduit) | Yes (nest holds things) |
| Action | "Send via ivy" | "Check your nest" |
| Feeling | Active, growing | Safe, home |

Nest feels more like an INBOX—a container for messages.
Ivy feels more like the NETWORK—how messages travel.

What if BOTH exist?

Ivy = the email system (the network)
Nest = your inbox (where messages land)

But that's overcomplicating...

---

## Simplifying

The user experience is:
1. Someone sends you a message
2. It travels encrypted
3. It arrives in your inbox
4. You read and respond

What do you CALL the system?

"I got an Ivy" - awkward
"Check your Ivy" - is Ivy the inbox or the message?

"I got a message in my Nest" - clear
"Check your Nest" - clear

But "Ivy" as a name has existed for this project.
And the concealment metaphor DOES work.

---

## Final Consideration: The @grove.place Address

Your email is yourname@grove.place

This is part of your TREE. Your identity in the grove.

The email system is how messages reach your tree.
Not a separate thing—integrated with your grove identity.

So it should feel like part of the tree metaphor:

- Foliage = how you look
- Heartwood = who you are
- Rings = your growth
- Ivy = your messages (growing along your tree)
- Nest = where messages land?

Actually, ivy DOES grow on trees.
Your ivy is growing along your tree's lattice.
Messages travel along YOUR ivy.

---

## The Moment of Decision

I've walked the forest for a while now.

**Ivy** works if we embrace both aspects:
1. Connection (climbing, linking)
2. Concealment (covering, hiding)

The current description emphasizes connection.
We could rewrite to include concealment.

**Nest** works if we want to emphasize:
1. Container (inbox metaphor)
2. Safety (protected, hidden)
3. Home (messages "come home")

But nest loses the CONNECTION aspect.
Email is about reaching out, not just receiving.

---

## My Recommendation: Keep Ivy, Deepen the Metaphor

Ivy already exists. The domain is claimed. The name is established.

The fix isn't to rename—it's to COMPLETE the metaphor.

Ivy isn't just about climbing and connecting.
Ivy CONCEALS. What it covers, it hides.

The new description should emphasize:
- Messages travel along ivy (connection)
- Ivy wraps and conceals them (privacy)
- Zero-knowledge = the ivy covers what it carries

---

## Proposed Updated Entry

## Ivy
**Private Email** - `ivy.grove.place`

Ivy climbs the lattice, reaching from tree to tree, point to point.
But ivy also conceals—what it wraps, it hides from view.
Watch ivy grow across a wall and the wall disappears.
Watch ivy climb a trellis and the structure vanishes into green.

Ivy is zero-knowledge email for your @grove.place address.
Your messages travel wrapped in encryption, visible only
to sender and recipient. Grove carries them but cannot read them—
the ivy conceals what moves along its vines.

Threaded conversations. Rich text. Attachments that arrive sealed.
Contact form submissions land as threads. Professional correspondence
for your blog, private by design. Not a Gmail replacement—just
the inbox that lives where you do, encrypted at the source.

*Connected and concealed.*

---

## The Visualization (Final)

The ivy climbs your tree.
Messages travel along it, wrapped in green.
What's inside is yours alone.

## Summary

**Keep "Ivy"** - the name works.

**Update the metaphor** to include BOTH:
- Connection (linking sender and recipient)
- Concealment (wrapping messages in encryption)

The tagline shifts from just "connecting" to:

*"Connected and concealed."*

Or:

*"What ivy covers, only you can see."*
