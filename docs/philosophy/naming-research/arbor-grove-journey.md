# A Journey Through the Grove: The Admin Panel

*Scratchpad for questioning "Arbor" and finding the right name for the blog control center*

---

## The Question

What should we call the place where you manage your blog?

Currently: **Arbor**
Before that: **admin-panel-spec.md** (functional name)

An arbor is a shaded garden structure, often covered with climbing vines. A trellis. A gateway. A place to sit in dappled sunlight.

But is that what managing a blog feels like?

---

## Let Me Walk Through the Grove First

```
                                    .  *  .

                        |     |   |   |   |   |     |

                                      |
                              ROOTS INTERTWINE
                            (mycelium network)

                    You are here → 🧑 (walking through)
```

I enter the grove.

I pass the **Meadow** where others gather.
I walk beneath the **Shade** that protects my words.
I see **Foliage** above me—every tree's unique canopy.

I find MY tree. My blog. My place in the grove.

But I don't want to just *look* at it from outside.
I want to *tend* it. Shape it. Add to it. Care for it.

Where do I go?

---

## What IS This Thing, Fundamentally?

### Is it a PLACE?
- Meadow, Nook, Pantry, Clearing are places
- The admin panel... is it a place I go to?
- "I'm going to manage my blog" = going somewhere

### Is it a TOOL?
- Forage is a tool (you use it to find domains)
- But the admin isn't just a tool—it's ongoing, intimate

### Is it a STRUCTURE?
- Lattice is a structure (framework beneath)
- An arbor IS a structure...

### Is it a FEATURE OF THE TREE?
- Foliage (the visible canopy)
- Heartwood (the identity core)
- Rings (the private growth)
- The admin touches all of these but isn't one of them

### Is it a CONNECTION?
- Ivy, Mycelium, Reeds
- No—managing your blog isn't about connecting to others

---

## What Do You DO in This Place?

Let me list the activities:

1. **Write posts** (creating new growth)
2. **Manage pages** (shaping structure)
3. **Upload images** (decorating, adding life)
4. **Configure settings** (nurturing conditions)
5. **View drafts** (tending what's growing)
6. **Check analytics** (reading your rings)
7. **Customize theme** (adjusting your foliage)

These are all acts of **TENDING**.

You're not just visiting. You're caring for something that's yours.

## Where Do You Tend a Tree?

              ╰──────────────────────────────╯
```

In the real world, where do you tend growing things?

- A **potting shed** — where you work with plants, behind the scenes
- A **greenhouse** — where things grow under your care
- A **study** — where you write (but not nature-themed)
- A **workshop** — where you build (already used on landing page)
- Inside the **tree itself** — in the hollow, in the heart

---

## Let's Question "Arbor"

An **arbor** is:
- A shaded garden structure
- Often covered with climbing vines
- A gateway, archway, or bower
- A place of peace and contemplation
- Decorative, beautiful

```
        .  🌿  .  🌿  .  🌿  .
      🌿                       🌿
      .   ╭───────────────╮   .
      🌿  │               │  🌿
      .   │   AN ARBOR    │   .
      🌿  │               │  🌿
      .   │  You sit here │   .
      🌿  │  under vines  │  🌿
      .   ╰───────────────╯   .
      🌿 /                 \ 🌿
        /                   \
       🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱🧱
```

This is beautiful. But is it accurate?

When I'm in my blog's admin panel, am I...
- **Sitting peacefully?** Or working actively?
- **Relaxing in shade?** Or creating, shaping, building?
- **Passing through a gateway?** Or staying to work?

An arbor feels **passive**.
Managing a blog is **active**.

---

## Hmm. What About Vines?

Wait—**Vines** are already part of the ecosystem!

From the naming doc:
> **Vines** are a feature of Lattice: the widgets and content that fill your blog's gutters (the sidebar margins alongside your main content). Like vines climbing a trellis, they grow alongside your posts.

So if vines climb the **Lattice** (the framework)...
And an **arbor** is a structure where vines grow...

There's resonance there. But does it help?

An arbor is where vines *grow and display*.
But the admin is where you *make things*—where the growth originates.

---

## Let Me Try Some Other Words

### The Hollow

```
       🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳
      🌳          🌳
     🌳  ╭─────╮   🌳
    🌳   │HOLLOW│   🌳
    🌳   │ ▪ ▪ │   🌳
    🌳   │  ▼  │   🌳  <-- Inside the tree
    🌳   │     │   🌳
     🌳  ╰─────╯  🌳
      🌳        🌳
       🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳
```

A hollow in a tree is:
- The inside space, hidden from view
- Where creatures nest, where treasures are kept
- Where owls watch, where squirrels store

"Go to the hollow to write a new post."

But **hollow** also means *empty*... that's problematic.
And **Amber** is already storage (preserved treasures).

### The Den

A den is:
- A private retreat
- Where animals raise their young (your posts?)
- Cozy, intimate, *yours*

"The den is where you tend your blog."

But "den" has predator connotations (lion's den, bear's den).
Not quite the vibe.

### The Bower

A bower is:
- Similar to arbor (a leafy shelter)
- BUT ALSO: the elaborate structure built by bowerbirds
- Bowerbirds **curate and decorate** their bowers to attract mates
- They arrange treasures, organize beauty

"The bower is where you curate your space."

This has more *active* energy than arbor. You're BUILDING the bower, not sitting under it.

### The Study

Warm, writerly... but not nature-themed. Skip.

### The Shed (or Potting Shed)

```
    ╭────────────────────────╮
    │  🪴  POTTING SHED  🪴   │
    │                        │
    │   ▪ Tools on hooks     │
    │   ▪ Seeds in jars      │
    │   ▪ Plants being       │
    │     tended             │
    │   ▪ Soil under nails   │
    │                        │
    ╰────────────────────────╯
```

A potting shed is:
- Where the *work* of gardening happens
- Behind the scenes, not for display
- Where seeds become plants
- Utilitarian but cozy

"Shed" is too utilitarian. "Potting Shed" is two words.
But the *vibe* is right—this is where work happens.

### The Roost

A roost is:
- Where birds rest and tend their nests
- High up in the tree
- Private, personal

But roosting is passive (sleeping, resting). Not active creation.

### The Nest

```
         ╭───────────────╮
       ╭─│  🪺 THE NEST  │─╮
      /  │               │  \
     /   │  Where you    │   \
    │    │  build your   │    │
    │    │  home         │    │
     \   │               │   /
      \  ╰───────────────╯  /
       ╲                   ╱
        ╲_______________╱
```

A nest is:
- Something you BUILD
- Your personal creation
- Where you arrange materials into something livable
- Intimate, personal, *yours*

"The nest is where you build your blog."

But **Nook** is already taken (private video sharing) and feels close.

### The Crown

The crown of a tree is:
- The canopy, where new growth happens
- The topmost branches reaching for light
- Where the tree extends itself

"The crown is where you shape your tree."

But "crown" has hierarchical/royal connotations. Not cozy enough.

---

## Wait. Let Me Step Back.

I keep circling around the same ideas:
- A place that's private, personal
- Where you do the work of creating
- Where you tend what's growing
- That's part of your tree, not separate from it

But maybe I'm overthinking the PLACE aspect.

What if it's less about WHERE you are, and more about WHAT you're doing?

---

## What IS the Activity?

When you manage your blog, you are:

**Tending** — caring for what grows
**Crafting** — making something with your hands
**Cultivating** — encouraging growth
**Pruning** — shaping what exists
**Planting** — adding new things
**Nurturing** — feeding what needs care

What if the name is about the activity, not the place?

### Tend

"Tend your blog."
`{username}.grove.place/tend`

Simple. Active. Verb-based.

But most Grove names are nouns (places, things).

### The Nursery

```
    ╭────────────────────────────╮
    │     🌱 THE NURSERY 🌱      │
    │                            │
    │   Where young things grow  │
    │   Under careful attention  │
    │   Protected, nurtured      │
    │   Until they're ready      │
    │                            │
    ╰────────────────────────────╯
```

A nursery is:
- Where plants are raised before they're ready for the garden
- Where seeds become seedlings
- A place of careful attention
- Professional, but warm

"The nursery is where your posts grow."

Wait—this has overlap with **Plant** (the onboarding system, internal name Seedbed).

From the naming doc:
> **Plant** is Grove's onboarding system: the complete flow for new users from initial signup through payment, interactive tour, and handoff to their own blog.

And:
> A seedbed is where seeds are planted and nurtured until they're ready to grow on their own.

So Plant/Seedbed is about new USERS growing into bloggers.
Nursery would be about new POSTS growing into published pieces.

Different domains. But the overlap feels confusing.

---

## Let Me Visualize the Admin Experience

```
    YOU → Enter the admin at {you}.grove.place/admin
          │
          ├── Dashboard (overview of your tree)
          │   └── "How is my tree doing?"
          │
          ├── Posts (branches and leaves)
          │   └── "I want to write something new"
          │
          ├── Pages (permanent structure)
          │   └── "I want to shape my tree"
          │
          ├── Media (decorations, images)
          │   └── "I want to add beauty"
          │
          ├── Settings (the roots, the foundation)
          │   └── "I want to adjust how things work"
          │
          └── Theme (Foliage connection)
              └── "I want to change how I look"
```

The admin is... the INSIDE of your tree.

When you look at a tree from outside, you see foliage.
When you're inside your tree, managing it, you're in...

**The Heartwood?** No—that's authentication (your core identity).
**The Hollow?** Maybe, but that implies emptiness.
**The Trunk?** Too structural, not intimate.
**The Rings?** No—that's analytics (private growth history).

---

## What If It's About the DESK?

```
            ╭─────────────────────────────╮
            │                             │
            │      📝 A WRITING DESK      │
            │         UNDER THE           │
            │           CANOPY            │
            │                             │
            │    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      │
            │      │ ⌨️ ▢ ☕ │           │
            │      ╰─────────╯            │
            │                             │
            │     🌿  🌿  🌿  🌿           │
            ╰─────────────────────────────╯
```

What if the admin panel isn't a place you GO TO, but a place you SIT?

A desk in the forest. A writing spot.
Under the canopy. In the shade. Your spot.

---

## Actually... The Desk... The Bureau...

Wait.

What's a natural version of a desk?

In old usage, a **secretary** was a writing desk with compartments.
A **bureau** is also a desk with storage.

But those aren't nature words.

What if it's simpler?

### The Desk

No—too modern, too office.

### The Table

"Your table in the grove."

Closer. A table is where you work. Where things are spread out.
But table is generic.

### The Stump

```
          🌿  🌿
           \  /
      🌿────▇▇────🌿
            ▇▇
     ═══════▇▇═══════
            ▇▇
         (ground)
```

An old stump in a clearing.
Flat on top. You sit on a nearby rock.
You spread your papers on the stump.
You write.

"The stump is where you work."

But stump implies something that was cut down. Death. Loss.
That's not the vibe.

---

## Stepping Back: What Does "Arbor" Get Right?

Okay, let me steelman "Arbor" for a moment.

An arbor is:
- Part of a garden (fits the nature theme)
- A structure you build and maintain
- Where vines grow (connects to "Vines" feature)
- A gateway or passage (the portal to your blog's inner workings)
- Shaded, protected (private, for you)

An arbor is NOT:
- Where you actively work
- A workshop or creation space
- Something inherently productive

**The tension:** Arbor is beautiful but passive. The admin panel is functional and active.

---

## What If That's Okay?

What if the admin panel SHOULD feel peaceful?

Grove's whole ethos is:
- Slower
- Quieter
- More intentional
- "Write like you're helping me speak, not perform"

Maybe the admin panel shouldn't feel like a *workshop* at all.
Maybe it should feel like... a shaded place where you sit and tend.

Not frantic productivity.
Not dashboard overwhelm.

Just... tending your garden in the cool shade.

```
    ╭─────────────────────────────────────╮

    │     🌿 THE ARBOR 🌿                 │
    │                                     │
    │     You enter through the vines.    │
    │     Dappled light filters through.  │
    │                                     │
    │     There's a table here.           │
    │     Your drafts spread before you.  │
    │                                     │
    │     No rush. No pressure.           │
    │     Just you and your words.        │
    │                                     │
    │     Tend what grows.                │
    │                                     │
    ╰─────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Hmm. When I describe it this way... Arbor starts to feel right.

---

## But Wait—Let Me Explore One More Direction

### The Workshop Problem

"Workshop" is already used on the landing page (the tools showcase).
But what if we think about workshop-like concepts?

**A Smithy** — where things are forged (too aggressive)
**A Mill** — where things are processed (too industrial)
**A Loom** — already taken (Durable Objects pattern)
**A Forge** — fire and metal (doesn't fit)
**A Kiln** — firing clay (not quite)

None of these fit the nature-calm aesthetic.

### What About Something Tree-Specific?

**The Bole** — the trunk of a tree
**The Burl** — a growth on a tree (actually beautiful, used for woodworking)
**The Bough** — a large branch
**The Graft** — where new growth is attached
**The Cambium** — the growing layer under bark

These are too obscure. Most people won't know what a bole or cambium is.

### What About Something Cottage-y?

Grove has a cottage aesthetic. Warm, cozy, intentional.

**The Hearth** — but Fireside (Wisp mode) is close to this
**The Parlor** — a sitting room (too formal)
**The Attic** — private, personal (but disconnected)
**The Study** — still not nature-themed
**The Cellar** — underground, hidden (too dark)

---

## The Moment of Truth

Let me compare my top candidates:

| Name | Vibe | Connection to Admin | Problem |
|------|------|---------------------|---------|
| **Arbor** | Peaceful, shaded, vine-covered | A structure you tend | Passive, not active |
| **Bower** | Curated, decorated, built | Where you arrange your treasures | Very similar to Arbor |
| **Hollow** | Private, inside the tree | Where you do hidden work | "Hollow" = empty |
| **Nest** | Personal, built, intimate | Where you build your home | Close to "Nook" |
| **Nursery** | Growing, nurturing | Where posts grow | Overlaps with Plant |

---

## What If I Visualize the Arbor Differently?

An arbor doesn't have to be just a sitting place.

An arbor is also where you:
- Train vines to grow
- Clip and shape
- Watch things flourish
- Attach new growth

```
         🌿 ~~~~~~ 🌿 ~~~~~~ 🌿
        |                       |
        |   THE ARBOR           |
        |                       |
        |   - Plant new posts   |
        |   - Train your vines  |
        |   - Shape your growth |
        |   - Watch it flourish |
        |                       |
        🌿 ~~~~~~ 🌿 ~~~~~~ 🌿

        "Tend your growth in the arbor."
```

When I think of it as a place where you ACTIVELY TRAIN AND SHAPE growth (not just sit passively), it works better.

---

## My Landing

I've walked through the grove. I've questioned.

**The word "Arbor" does work.** Here's why:

1. **It connects to Vines** — Arbors are where vines grow and are trained. The admin panel has "Vines" (sidebar widgets). You tend your vines in the arbor.

2. **It's about structure** — An arbor is something you build and maintain, like your blog itself.

3. **It evokes shade and peace** — Grove's ethos is slower, calmer. The admin shouldn't feel like a frantic dashboard.

4. **It's a gateway** — Arbors are often entrances to gardens. The admin is the entrance to your blog's inner workings.

5. **It invites tending** — You don't just pass through an arbor; you tend it, shape it, watch things grow on it.

**What I'd add to the philosophy:**

> ## Arbor
> **Your Blog's Control Center** · `{you}.grove.place/admin`
>
> An arbor is a garden structure where vines climb and intertwine. It's a shaded passage, a place to pause and work in dappled light. Not a dashboard with blinking alerts—just a quiet place to tend what grows.
>
> Arbor is where you manage your blog: write posts, upload images, configure settings, shape your Vines. It's the inside of your tree, where the real work happens. Not frantic productivity. Just careful attention to something you're growing.
>
> *Tend your growth in the arbor.*

---

## Alternative Considered: Bower

If we wanted something more *active*, **Bower** captures the bowerbird's creative curation—arranging, decorating, building something beautiful.

But **Arbor** has an advantage: it directly connects to **Vines** (which are already part of the system).

An arbor is literally where vines grow.

The admin panel is where you tend your Vines.

That's poetic.

---

## Final Answer

**Keep Arbor.**

The name works once you lean into it properly:
- Not a passive sitting place
- An active tending place
- Where vines climb and you shape them
- Shaded, calm, intentional
- Your blog's inner garden

The key is framing: Arbor isn't where you *relax*. It's where you *cultivate*.
