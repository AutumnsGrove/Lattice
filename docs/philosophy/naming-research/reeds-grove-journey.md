# A Journey Through the Grove: Comments

*Scratchpad for finding the right name for the blog comment system*

---

## The Scene

```
                                    ~~~
                              ~~~ WATER ~~~
                            ~~~ (a pond?) ~~~
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                   |
                               ||| |||
                              ||||| |||||     <- Reeds?
                             ||||||||||||||
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
           🌲                                              🌲
            \\            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                 //
             \\          ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~               //
              \\        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                //
               🌲       ||| |||||| |||||              🌲
                \\     ||||||||||||||||||            //
                 \\   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~           //
                  🌲                              🌲
                   |                              |
    ════════════════|══════════════════════════════|══════════════
                    |                              |
                       ROOTS BENEATH
```

Wait. Reeds are at the water's edge. They're in a different part of the ecosystem than the trees. Is that right for comments?

---

## Walking Through...

I enter the grove. My blog is my tree—standing somewhere in this forest.

I write a post. It lives in my tree's branches.

Someone reads my post. They want to respond.

What do they do?

Do they:
- Walk to the water's edge and sway with other reeds?
- Sit at the base of my tree and leave a mark?
- Send something back through roots?
- Carve something into the bark?
- Leave a stone on my trail?

---

## What IS a Comment?

A comment is:
- A **response** to something I wrote
- A **conversation** starter (can lead to threads)
- A **gift** from a reader (taking time to engage)
- A **mark** they leave behind
- Sometimes **private** (just for me)
- Sometimes **public** (for everyone)

Comments happen AT the post. They're attached to my words.
They're not separate from my tree—they're part of it.

```
         ┌─────────────────────────────┐
         │        MY BLOG POST         │
         │                             │
         │  (my words, my thoughts)    │
         │                             │
         └──────────────┬──────────────┘
                        │
              ┌─────────┴─────────┐
              │    COMMENTS       │
              │                   │
              │  ├─ Reader A      │
              │  │  └─ My reply   │
              │  │     └─ A again │
              │  │                │
              │  └─ Reader B      │
              │     └─ Reader C   │
              └───────────────────┘
```

Comments are THREADED. They nest. They branch.

---

## Does "Reeds" Fit?

```
Reeds:
  ||||||||||||||||||||
  ||||||||||||||||||||
  ||||||||||||||||||||
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        WATER

Reeds are:
  - All at the same level (no hierarchy)
  - Swaying together (communal, but undifferentiated)
  - At the water's edge (separate from trees)
  - Whispering (gentle sound)
  - Not attached to anything specific
```

But comments ARE:
- Hierarchical (threads, nesting)
- Attached to specific posts
- Part of the blog, not separate
- Conversations, not whispers
- Responses, not ambient sound

---

## The Problem with Reeds

Reeds don't RESPOND. They just... sway.

Reeds are at the water's edge—separate from the trees.
But comments are AT the tree. They're part of the blog experience.

Reeds whisper to each other.
But comments are directed AT something. They respond to the post.

```
    🌲 My Tree (my blog)
     |
     |───────────> POST: "Here's what I think about..."
     |                    |
     |                    └──> COMMENT: "I agree because..."
     |                              |
     |                              └──> REPLY: "But what about..."
     |
     |
    ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Comments are like... branches of conversation growing from my main trunk.

---

## What DOES Respond in Nature?

Things that respond to a stimulus:

- **Echo** — but that was rejected for support (shouting into void)
- **Call and response** — birds calling, expecting answer
- **Roots sending signals** — but that's Mycelium
- **Something carved into bark** — lasting, visible
- **Lichen growing on bark** — attaches, adds texture
- **Moss** — grows on trees, soft, community of tiny things
- **Birdsong** — multiple voices, conversation

---

## Wait. What if Comments Are Like Birds?

```
              🐦     🐦
           🐦          🐦
        🐦    🌲         🐦
           \   |   /
            \  |  /
             \ | /
              \|/
         Birds gathering
         in my tree
```

Birds:
- Come to your tree
- Some sing
- Some just listen
- They have conversations
- They respond to each other
- Some are regulars, some passing through

But birds feel too... fleeting? They fly away.
Comments are permanent. They stay.

---

## What About Moss?

```
        🌲
       /|\
      / | \
     /  |  \
    ----+----
        |  ⬤ moss
        | ⬤⬤⬤ more moss
        |⬤⬤⬤⬤⬤ gathering
        |⬤⬤⬤⬤⬤⬤⬤ on the bark
    ════|════════════════
        |
```

Moss:
- Grows ON the tree (not separate)
- Soft, gentle presence
- Accumulates over time
- Community of tiny voices
- Doesn't harm the tree—symbiotic
- Adds texture and character

"Moss grows on your posts"
"The moss gathers"

Hmm. But moss doesn't TALK. It just... exists.

---

## What About a Chorus?

Multiple voices singing together.
Aria is one voice. Chorus is many.

But Aria is already music curation.
And "chorus" feels performative—comments aren't performing.

---

## Murmur?

A murmur is:
- A low, continuous sound
- Many voices blended together
- Gentle, not overwhelming
- The sound of a crowd, but soft

"A murmur of conversation"
"Murmur gathers at your posts"

Murmur.grove.place?

But murmur is indistinct. Comments are specific—each one is a clear voice.

---

## Actually... Let Me Step Back

What is the EXPERIENCE of comments in Grove?

1. You write a post
2. Someone reads it
3. They feel moved to respond
4. They write back—either privately (just you) or publicly
5. You read their response
6. Maybe you reply
7. Maybe others join in
8. A conversation grows

It's a CONVERSATION. It's DIALOGUE.

---

## The Grove Keeper and the Visitors

```
    🌲  <-- My tree (my blog)
     |
     |   👤 "I loved this post"
     |      |
     |      +--👤 Author: "Thanks!"
     |            |
     |            +--👤 "Have you read..."
     |
     |   👤 "This made me think about..."
     |
```

Visitors come to my tree.
They sit at the base.
They talk.
Sometimes just to me. Sometimes to each other.

It's like... a gathering at the base of my tree.

---

## The Base of the Tree

What's at the base of a tree?

- Roots (but that's underground—Mycelium)
- Fallen leaves (but those decompose)
- A hollow (where things are left)
- A clearing (where people gather)
- A circle of stones (where conversations happen)
- A fire pit (but Fireside is taken)

---

## Roots (Above Ground)

```
        🌲
         |
    ═════|═════════════════
        \|/
       \\|//
      \\\|///
       ROOTS
```

Some trees have visible roots above ground.
People sit on roots. They're part of the tree.

"Sitting among the roots"
"Conversations at the roots"

**Roots**?

But roots are underground connectivity—that's Mycelium territory.

---

## Understory

In a forest, the understory is the layer beneath the canopy.
Where smaller plants grow in the shade of big trees.
Where conversations happen at a quieter level.

```
    CANOPY (your posts—the main content)
        |
        |
    UNDERSTORY (conversations beneath)
        |
        |
    FOREST FLOOR
```

"Understory"

The conversations that grow beneath your main content.
Not as prominent, but part of the ecosystem.

---

## Let Me Test Some Names

**Understory** - `understory` integrated
- Too literal? Too botanical?
- "Conversations in the understory"
- Feels educational rather than warm

**Moss** - `moss` integrated
- Grows on trees, accumulates, soft
- "Moss gathers on your posts"
- But moss doesn't talk...

**Murmur** - `murmur` integrated
- The sound of quiet conversation
- "A murmur of responses"
- But too indistinct?

**Gather** - `gather` integrated
- People gathering at your tree
- "The gathering beneath the post"
- But "gather" is a verb, not a noun

**Gathering** - `gathering` integrated
- "The Gathering"
- A place where people come together
- "Join the gathering"
- But maybe too formal?

---

## Back to Reeds

Let me be fair to Reeds.

```
           ||||||||||||||
          ||||||||||||||||
         ||||||||||||||||||
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              WATER
```

Reeds:
- Sway together (community)
- Whisper in the breeze (gentle sound)
- At the water's edge (margins)
- Different from trees (blog is tree, comments are reeds?)

The metaphor could be:
- Your POST is the tree
- COMMENTS are the reeds at the edge of your pond
- The POND is the space your post creates

```
         🌲 POST
          |
          |
    ~~~~~~|~~~~~~  Your pond (the space created by your post)
     |||||||||||||  Reeds (comments swaying at the edge)
    ~~~~~~|~~~~~~
          |
    ══════|══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Actually... that's kind of nice?

The post creates a pond—a pool of thought.
Reeds gather at the edges to respond.
They whisper together.

---

## But Here's the Problem

Comments are THREADED. They nest. They branch.

Reeds don't branch. They're all at the same level.
```
        |||||||||||||||
        |||||||||||||||
        |||||||||||||||
        (no hierarchy)
```

But comment threads look like:

```
├── Comment A
│   ├── Reply to A
│   │   └── Reply to reply
│   └── Another reply to A
└── Comment B
    └── Reply to B
```

That's a TREE structure. Branches. Not reeds.

---

## Oh.

Comments are... branches?

```
        🌲 POST (trunk)
        /|\
       / | \
      /  |  \
     /   |   \
    🌿   🌿   🌿  Top-level comments (main branches)
   /|   /|\   |\
  🌿🌿 🌿🌿🌿 🌿🌿  Replies (smaller branches)
      /|\
     🌿🌿🌿        Deeper replies (twigs)
```

Comments are branches growing from the post.
The conversation BRANCHES.

**Branches**?

---

## Testing "Branches"

"Branches grow from your post"
"Join the branches"
"The conversation branches out"

branches.grove.place? No—that would be a subdomain, but comments are integrated.

But wait—the word "branches" is so common. It's not distinctive enough.

And it might conflict with Git branches (development terms).

---

## What About "Boughs"?

A bough is a main branch of a tree.

"Boughs of conversation"
"Thoughts gathering on the boughs"

Poetic, but... still doesn't quite capture the conversational aspect.

---

## Let Me Think About What Makes Comments Special

In Grove, comments are:
1. **Private OR public** (dual nature)
2. **Author-moderated** (you control your space)
3. **Threaded** (conversations that branch)
4. **Simple** (no reactions, just words)
5. **Responses** (always responding to something)

The emphasis is on:
- GENUINE conversation (not performative likes)
- AUTHOR CONTROL (your tree, your rules)
- SIMPLICITY (just words)

---

## Margin Notes?

In old books, readers would write in the margins.
Marginalia—the notes in the margins.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                          │ margin   │
│  The main text of the post...            │ notes    │
│                                          │ here     │
│  More content here...                    │          │
│                                          │ thoughts │
│                                          │ and      │
│                                          │ replies  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Marginalia**?

- Responses written at the edges
- Personal notes
- A tradition of readers engaging with text

But marginalia are usually solitary. Comments are communal.

---

## The Conversation Aspect

What in nature is a back-and-forth conversation?

- Bird calls (call and response)
- Cricket songs
- Frog choruses
- Wind through leaves

Wind through leaves... the rustling sound...

**Rustle**?

"A rustle of responses"
"The leaves rustle with conversation"

---

## Actually, Let Me Come Back to Reeds

The more I think about it...

Reeds DO whisper together. That's conversational.
Reeds ARE communal. They don't stand alone.
Reeds ARE gentle. Not overwhelming.
Reeds ARE at the edge. Comments are marginalia, in a sense.

The threading problem—maybe it doesn't matter?

The METAPHOR isn't about the visual structure.
It's about the FEELING.

```
    Comments should feel like:
    - Whispering
    - Communal
    - Gentle
    - At the edge (not overwhelming the main content)
    - Swaying together in response to the wind (the post)
```

Reeds capture that FEELING better than "Branches" does.

---

## Testing Reeds

> "Reeds is where you whisper back to the author."

> "Reeds is the murmur of response at the edge of every post."

> "Reeds sway together at the water's edge."

The tagline from grove-naming.md:
*"Whisper together at the water's edge."*

That's actually beautiful.

---

## The Counter-Argument: Threads

But what about the threaded nature?

```
In Reeds:
    ├── Reed 1 (someone's comment)
    │   ├── Reply (another reed responding)
    │   │   └── Reply to reply (deeper response)
    │   └── Another reply
    └── Reed 2 (different comment)
```

Could reeds have... baby reeds? Offshoots?
Reeds DO spread from rhizomes. They branch underground and pop up.

```
       ||| ||| ||| |||
       ||| ||| ||| |||    <- visible reeds
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    ────────┬──────────    <- rhizome network
       ┌────┴────┐
       ┌────┴────┐
       └────┬────┘         <- threads are the hidden roots
    ═══════════════════
```

The VISIBLE part is the communal swaying.
The STRUCTURE beneath is the threaded conversation.

Actually, that works!

---

## Alternative: Clearing (Already Taken)

Clearing is status page. Can't use that.

---

## Alternative: Hollow

A hollow in a tree where messages are left.

"Leave your thoughts in the hollow"

But that's more one-way. Not conversational.

---

## Alternative: Fireside (Taken by Wisp)

Already a Wisp mode for conversations that become posts.

---

## Alternative: Chorus

Multiple voices singing together.
A chorus of responses.

But Aria is already music-adjacent.
And chorus feels performative—public stage.
Comments should feel more intimate.

---

## Let Me Visualize Both Options

**REEDS (keeping current name)**
```
Your Post (creates a pond)
    |
    v
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   ||| ||| ||| ||| |||
   ||| ||| ||| ||| |||     <- Reeds gathering at the edge
   |||||||||||||||||||||
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    |
    └── Connected beneath
        (threaded rhizomes)
```

Feeling: Gentle, communal, whispering, at the margins

**BRANCHES (alternative)**
```
Your Post (the trunk)
    |
    ├── Comment 1
    │   ├── Reply
    │   └── Reply
    └── Comment 2
        └── Reply
```

Feeling: Structural, tree-like, logical

---

## The Decision

**Reeds wins.**

Here's why:

1. **The FEELING is right.** Comments should feel gentle, communal, whispering—not structural or architectural. Reeds evokes exactly that.

2. **Water is different.** Comments ARE a different element than the main post. The post is your tree. Comments are the reeds at your pond. Different, but connected.

3. **"Whisper together at the water's edge"** is a beautiful tagline that captures exactly what commenting should feel like in Grove.

4. **Threading can be rhizomatic.** Reeds spread through root systems. The visible reeds sway together; the connections happen beneath. That's actually a perfect metaphor for threaded conversations.

5. **It's already named Reeds.** And after this journey, I believe it's the RIGHT name.

---

## The Final Entry

## Reeds
**Comments System** · *Integrated into blogs*

Reeds sway together at the water's edge, whispering in the breeze: a gentle murmur of community. They grow where water meets land—at the margins, not the center. Beneath the surface, their rhizomes connect, spreading sideways to create new growth.

Reeds is Grove's comment system, supporting both private replies (author-only) and public conversations (author-moderated). Like reeds responding to a breeze, comments respond to your posts—gentle, communal, swaying together. Threaded replies spread like rhizomes beneath, while the visible conversation whispers at the edges of your words. No reactions, no likes—just responses. HN-style simplicity.

*Whisper together at the water's edge.*

---

## Summary

After walking through the grove, I confirm that **Reeds** is the right name for Grove's comment system.

The key insight: Comments aren't branches growing from a tree (too structural). They're reeds at the water's edge—a different element, at the margins, whispering together in response to the breeze (your post). Threading works as rhizomes beneath the surface.

The metaphor captures:
- The gentle, non-performative nature of Grove comments
- The communal aspect (reeds sway together)
- The marginal position (at the edge, not overwhelming the main content)
- The responsive nature (reeds respond to wind, comments respond to posts)
- Threading (rhizomes spread beneath, creating connected growth)

*Reeds it is.*
