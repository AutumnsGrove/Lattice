# Naming Journey: The Visitor Experience Layer

*January 13, 2026*

---

## What Are We Naming?

The things visitors SEE and INTERACT WITH when they visit someone's site:
- Custom cursors (leaf cursor, sparkle trails)
- Guestbooks (sign my guestbook!)
- Hit counters ("You are visitor #1,247")
- Shrines (dedicated spaces for things you love)
- Weird artifacts (marquee text, fortune cookies, magic 8-balls)
- Link gardens (curated links to other sites/foliage)
- Under construction badges
- Clip art / decorations
- Status indicators

This is NOT:
- **Foliage** — That's theming (colors, fonts, layouts)
- **Terrarium** — That's the EDITOR where you create
- **Forests** — That's community aggregation & discovery

---

## Visualizing the Grove

```
                              ☀️
                    🌲    🌲    🌲    🌲
                 🌲    🌳 ← YOUR TREE    🌲
              🌲          (your blog)         🌲
           🌲     🌲    🌲    🌲    🌲    🌲
    ════════════════════════════════════════════════
                  ROOTS (Mycelium network)
```

Where things live:
- **Heartwood** — Deep inside the tree (identity, auth)
- **Foliage** — The leaves, the colors (theming)
- **Rings** — Inside the trunk (private analytics)
- **Terrarium** — A workshop space nearby (editor)
- **Meadow** — Open clearing (social space)

But what about the DECORATIONS on the tree itself?
The birdhouse hanging from a branch?
The wind chimes?
The guestbook nailed to the trunk?
The little shrine at the base?

---

## What IS This Thing?

**What is it, fundamentally?**
- It's not a place (like Meadow, Nook, Clearing)
- It's not quite a process (like Bloom, Press)
- It's the... ADORNMENTS? DECORATIONS? EMBELLISHMENTS?
- It's what makes your tree feel LIVED IN
- It's the personality layer on TOP of the theme

**What does it DO in the user's life?**
- Expresses personality beyond just colors
- Creates interactivity for visitors
- Makes the space feel ALIVE and PERSONAL
- Brings back the old web chaos energy
- Lets visitors PARTICIPATE (guestbooks, etc.)

**What emotion should it evoke?**
- Whimsy
- Nostalgia
- Personality
- Warmth
- "Someone LIVES here"
- Delight
- Surprise

## Walking Through...

I enter the grove. I see trees everywhere—each one someone's blog.

I walk toward a specific tree. As I approach, I notice... things.

There's a little wooden sign that says "Under Construction" with a tiny figure digging.

A wind chime tinkles in the branches.

A birdhouse hangs from a limb with a counter: "327 visitors have stopped by."

At the base of the tree, there's a small shrine with candles—a memorial to a beloved pet.

A guestbook is nailed to the trunk. I flip through it. People have left messages. I add mine.

Butterflies follow my gaze as I look around (custom cursor).

There's a little wooden sign pointing to other trees: "Friends' Groves →"

This isn't the tree itself. It's not the leaves (Foliage). It's the...

**The things you put ON and AROUND your tree.**

## Feeling It Out

The concept is:
> "The personal touches that make your space feel lived-in. The weird, wonderful, nostalgic decorations. The guestbook, the shrine, the sparkle cursor, the under-construction gif. Not the theme—the STUFF."

What word captures that?

**Flourish** feels right. It's:
- A decorative embellishment (noun)
- To thrive and grow (verb)
- "Add a flourish" is natural English
- It's not TOO nature-y, but fits the ecosystem
- "flourish.grove.place" sounds good

But **Moss** also feels right:
- Moss makes things feel LIVED IN
- Moss grows WHERE IT WANTS
- Moss is soft, varied, personal
- Moss is the sign of a healthy forest
- "moss.grove.place" is short and sweet

**Bower** is beautiful:
- A bower is a decorated shelter
- You CREATE a bower intentionally
- It's where beauty is cultivated
- "bower.grove.place" is lovely

---

## The Walk Continues...

I'm standing at someone's tree. I see all these decorations.

What would I CALL this collection of things?

"Check out my flourishes" ❓
"Check out my moss" ❓
"Check out my bower" ✅ (this works!)
"Visit my trinkets" ❓
"See my curios" ❓

Actually... if Foliage is "how the world sees your corner of the grove"...

Then this is... the DETAILS within that. The interactive bits. The personal touches.

What if it's not a separate thing but a PART of foliage?

No—the user said it feels separate. Foliage is THEMES (colors, fonts). This is STUFF (guestbooks, cursors, shrines).

---

## Testing Taglines

**Flourish**
> "Flourish is where you add the finishing touches."
> "Flourish is the personal touches that make your space feel alive."
> "Add a flourish to your foliage."

**Moss**

> "Moss is the soft, weird, personal stuff."
> "Moss makes your space feel lived in."

**Bower**
> "Bower is your decorated corner of the grove."
> "Bower is where you arrange the beautiful things."
> "A bower is always in bloom."

**Trinkets**
> "Trinkets is where your personal treasures live."
> "Trinkets is the drawer full of precious things."

---

## THE CLICK

Wait.

What if it's **Charms**?

A charm is:
- A small decorative object (jewelry charm)
- Something with magical properties
- Something that brings luck or protection
- A spell that enchants

"Add a little charm to your foliage."
"Your charms make your space magical."
"Charms: guestbooks, cursors, shrines, and more."

## More Candidates After the Click

## My Gut Says...

**Charms**.

> "Charms is where the magic lives. Guestbooks, cursors, shrines, hit counters, link gardens, under-construction gifs—the small, weird, wonderful touches that make your corner of the grove feel like home. Not your theme. Your *stuff*. The collection of talismans that say 'someone lives here.'"

> *A little magic goes a long way.*

OR

**Bower**.

> "A bower is a sheltered space made beautiful by intention. It's where you arrange the things that matter: a guestbook for visitors, a shrine for what you love, a garden of links to kindred spirits. Bower is the layer above your theme—the personal touches, the interactive bits, the old-web-chaos-energy that makes your space feel alive."

> *Tend your bower. Let it bloom.*

## Asking Autumn

Both feel right. Let me present both and see what resonates.

---

## THE DECISION

**CURIOS** 🔮

Autumn's gut said Curios. And they're right.

A cabinet of curiosities is EXACTLY what this is. The weird, wonderful, personal collection of things that make visitors go "ooh what's THAT?"

> *"Curios is your cabinet of wonders."*

`curios.grove.place`

Let's fucking GO.
