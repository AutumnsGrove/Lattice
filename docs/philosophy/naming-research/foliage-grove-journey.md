# A Journey Through the Grove

*Scratchpad for exploring the theming/visual customization system*

---

## The Question

**Foliage** is the current name for visual customization.
It's complete. It works. The domain is claimed.

But... is it *right*?

Let me walk through this.

---

## What IS Visual Theming?

Before I name it, I need to understand what it IS.

Visual theming is:
- Choosing colors for your blog
- Picking curated themes or building your own
- Accent colors to full theme control
- How the world sees your corner of the grove
- Making your space *yours*

It's not just appearance. It's *expression*.
It's not just what you wear. It's *who you are* visually.

---

## The Scene

```
                                    sun
                                    /|\
                            ~~~~~~~/ | \~~~~~~~
                          ~/   *     |     *   \~
                        ~/  *   FOLIAGE   *      \~
                       ~/ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \~
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                            |            |
              tree          |            |         tree
               \\           |            |          //
                \\   tree   |            |   tree  //
                 \\ //      |            |     \\ //
                  tree      |            |      tree
                   |        |            |       |
   ================|========|============|=======|=================
                   |        |            |       |
                   |        |   ROOTS    |       |
                   |________|____________|_______|
                            |
                       ~ mycelium ~
```

Every tree has a canopy. Every canopy is different.
The foliage IS what you see when you look at a tree.

---

## Walking Through the Grove

I enter the grove.

I walk past the **Meadow** where others gather in sunlight.
I pass through **Shade** where my words are protected.
I check my **Rings**—private, personal growth.
My **Heartwood** is verified—I am who I say I am.

Now I look up at my tree.

What do I see?

**Leaves.** Colors. The way light filters through my branches.
The silhouette against the sky. The way I look to others
who walk past my tree.

This is how people recognize me.
This is my visual identity in the grove.

---

## The Current Name: Foliage

Foliage = leaves. The visible part of a tree.

What I like about Foliage:
- It's the visual layer, literally
- It's what you see when you look at a tree
- No two canopies are the same
- It changes with the seasons (seasonal themes?)
- It's authentic—this IS what trees show the world

What might be missing:
- Does "foliage" capture the act of CHOOSING?
- Does it convey customization, or just appearance?
- Is it too passive? (Foliage just... is)

---

## The Deeper Question

Is theming about **what you ARE** or **what you CHOOSE**?

```
                    FOLIAGE (what you show)
                           |
                           v
    +----------------------------------------------+
    |                                              |
    |    Option A: Theming is APPEARANCE           |
    |    - Like hair color, eye color              |
    |    - Just how you look                       |
    |    - Foliage fits perfectly                  |
    |                                              |
    +----------------------------------------------+
                           |
                           v
    +----------------------------------------------+
    |                                              |
    |    Option B: Theming is EXPRESSION           |
    |    - Like clothes, style choices             |
    |    - Active decision-making                  |
    |    - Foliage is passive                      |
    |                                              |
    +----------------------------------------------+
```

Hmm. But wait.

In real life, trees don't CHOOSE their foliage.
In Grove, users DO choose their themes.

Is this a problem?

---

## Let Me Sit With This

Actually... maybe not.

In the Grove metaphor, users ARE trees. But they're *magical* trees.
Trees with agency. Trees that grow by writing, by sharing.
Trees that can choose how their leaves look.

The act of customization is the act of *growing your foliage*.
You're not putting on clothes. You're growing into who you are.

That actually feels... more authentic?

You're not masking. You're becoming.

---

## But What About Canopy?

Canopy was briefly in the codebase. Then removed as "redundant."

Let me think about this.

**Canopy** = the upper layer of trees, blocking the sky
**Foliage** = the leaves themselves

```
         ~~~~~CANOPY~~~~~
        /                 \
       /  leaves leaves    \
      /   FOLIAGE          \
     /     leaves           \
    /_______________________\
              |
              | trunk
              |
```

Canopy is structural. It's about the *coverage*.
Foliage is the material. It's about the *texture*.

For theming:
- Canopy suggests "protection" or "overhead structure"
- Foliage suggests "appearance" and "expression"

Foliage feels more right for visual customization.
Canopy might fit something else—maybe a header? A layout system?

---

## What About the ACT of Choosing?

Let me think about related words:

- **Plumage** - what birds wear to attract (too showy?)
- **Livery** - uniforms, colors (too formal?)
- **Palette** - colors (too technical?)
- **Mantle** - what you put on (a tree's mantle?)
- **Vestment** - ceremonial dress (too religious?)

None of these feel like Grove.

What about forest-specific things that involve choice?

- **Bloom** - already taken (ephemeral coding)
- **Blossom** - the flowers, what you choose to grow
- **Petals** - too specific, too small

---

## Seasons: A Hidden Feature?

Wait. Foliage changes with seasons.

Is that... intentional?

```
    SPRING              SUMMER              AUTUMN              WINTER

    light green         deep green          gold/red/orange     bare branches

      ~.~                ~~~                  ***                  /\
     ~.~.~              ~~~~~                *****                /  \
    ~.~.~.~            ~~~~~~~              *******              /    \
       |                  |                    |                   |
```

Seasonal themes could be a feature:
- Your blog shifts with the calendar
- Colors that change over time
- A living, breathing visual identity

"Foliage" captures this perfectly.
Your foliage IS seasonal. It DOES change.

---

## Testing the Tagline

The test: Can I write a natural one-liner?

> "Foliage is what you see when you look at a tree."

> "Foliage is your visual identity in the grove."

> "Your foliage is how the world sees your corner of the grove."

These all work. They feel right.

Now the completion test:

> "Foliage is where you **make your tree your own**."

> "Foliage is the **appearance you grow into**."

> "Foliage is **your leaves, your colors, your seasons**."

Yes. These work.

---

## Alternatives Considered (and Released)

**Canopy** - structural, not expressive. Feels like layout, not styling.

**Palette** - too technical, too "design tool." This is about identity, not art supplies.

**Plumage** - birds, not trees. Wrong ecosystem.

**Mantle** - too serious, too formal. Grove is warm.

**Bark** - the protective layer, not the visible beauty. Wrong concept.

**Crown** - interesting, but too regal. We're not monarchs here.

---

## The Realization

Foliage IS right.

Here's why:

1. **It's the visible layer** - exactly what theming is
2. **It's growth-based** - you grow your appearance, you don't put it on
3. **It changes with seasons** - themes can be temporal
4. **No two are alike** - every tree's foliage is unique
5. **It's natural** - not artificial, not performed

The "passiveness" I worried about earlier is actually a FEATURE.
In Grove, your visual identity isn't a costume.
It's an expression of who you're becoming.

## The Entry (as written in grove-naming.md)

> ## Foliage
> **Theming System** - `foliage.grove.place`
>
> Foliage is what you see when you look at a tree. The leaves,
> the color, the personality that changes with the seasons.
> No two canopies are quite the same.
>
> Foliage is visual customization for your blog, from accent
> colors to full theme control. Pick a curated theme or build
> your own. Make it warm, make it bold, make it *yours*.
> Your foliage is how the world sees your corner of the grove.

This is good. This belongs.

## One More Thought: Terrarium Connection

Terrarium is the creative canvas where you compose scenes.
Foliage is where those scenes become your visual identity.

```
    TERRARIUM                          FOLIAGE
    (create scenes)      -->           (apply to your tree)

    +-------------+                    ~~~~~~~~~~~
    | arrange     |                   /  *    *   \
    | trees,      |    export as    /  theme that  \
    | fireflies,  |   decoration   /    you built   \
    | flowers     |  ---------->  /___________________\
    +-------------+                       |
                                         your blog
```

Terrarium creates.
Foliage applies.

They're companions. They need different names.
And they have them.

---

## Conclusion

**Foliage is the right name.**

Not because I couldn't find anything better.
But because I walked through the grove, looked at my tree,
and realized: this IS what we're talking about.

The leaves. The colors. The way my tree looks to passersby.
The thing that changes with the seasons.
The thing that makes my corner of the grove unmistakably mine.

*Your foliage is how the world sees you.*
