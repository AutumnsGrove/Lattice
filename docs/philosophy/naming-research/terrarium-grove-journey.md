# A Journey Through the Grove
*Scratchpad for finding the right name for the creative canvas*

---

## The Scene

```

                              ~~ morning light ~~

                                    🌲
                    🌲              /|\              🌲
                   /|\    🌳      / | \     🌳     /|\
                  / | \   |||    /  |  \    |||   / | \
                 /  |  \  |||   /   |   \   |||  /  |  \
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                        GROVE FLOOR
                where things are gathered,
                arranged, and made into
                something new
        ========================================================
                       |    |    |    |
                  (roots connect beneath)
```

---

## What Am I Naming?

A creative canvas where you:
- Drag and drop nature components (trees, flowers, creatures, fireflies)
- Arrange them into scenes
- Export those scenes as decorations for your blog
- Header decorations, sidebar ornaments, footer scenes, backgrounds

It's like... digital bonsai meets scrapbooking meets MySpace customization.
But within Grove's curated nature palette.

---

## The Current Name: Terrarium

A terrarium is a sealed world under glass. Moss, tiny plants, small stones. You arrange it. You close it. You watch it grow (or remain static).

**What's RIGHT about Terrarium:**
- Contained, curated, intentional
- A miniature world you design
- Every element placed with purpose
- There's something precious about it

**What feels WRONG about Terrarium:**
- A terrarium is *sealed*. Closed off. Separate.
- You look at it from outside, through glass
- It's an artificial environment
- It's static once created
- The glass barrier feels... cold?

But more importantly: a terrarium is something you *observe*.
This tool is something you *use to create*.

Is there a difference between the thing you make and the place where you make it?

---

## Let Me Walk Through the Grove

```
    I wake up. I want to add decorations to my blog.
    I walk into the grove...

         🏠
          |
          | "I want to make my space prettier"
          |
          v
    Where do I go?

    - Not Foliage (that's applying themes, choosing colors)
    - Not Trails (that's planning, roadmapping)
    - Not Vineyard (that's documentation)

    I need a place where I can CREATE something visual.
    Where I can COMPOSE a scene.
    Where I can ARRANGE nature elements.

    What is that place in a forest?
```

---

## What IS This Activity?

In real life, what's the equivalent of "arranging nature elements into decorative scenes"?

- **Flower arranging** (ikebana, bouquets)
- **Terrarium building** (miniature worlds)
- **Garden design** (planning what goes where)
- **Diorama making** (scene composition)
- **Bonsai shaping** (intentional cultivation)
- **Wreath making** (gathering and arranging)
- **Fairy garden building** (tiny magical worlds)
- **Tablescaping** (arranging natural elements)
- **Forest floor gathering** (collecting and composing)

What they all share: **gathering** and **arranging** natural things with intention.

---

## The Categories of Grove Names

Let me map where this might fit:

**PLACES you go:**
- Meadow (social gathering)
- Nook (private sharing)
- Clearing (status visibility)
- Pantry (the shop)
- Porch (conversations)

**OBJECTS/PROCESSES:**
- Amber (storage/preservation)
- Bloom (ephemeral work)
- Patina (protection layers)
- Foliage (visual appearance)

**FEATURES OF TREES:**
- Heartwood (identity)
- Rings (private growth)

**CONNECTIONS:**
- Ivy (messages traveling)
- Mycelium (underground network)
- Reeds (whispered comments)

Where does "creative canvas" fit?

It's... a **PLACE** where you **CREATE** things that become **OBJECTS**.

The activity happens in a place.
The result is something you take elsewhere.

---

## The Studio Question

When I think about "where artists work," I think:
- Studio
- Workshop
- Atelier
- Workbench

But those feel industrial. Human-built. Not forest-native.

What's the forest equivalent of a creative workspace?

```
    In a forest, where do things get MADE?

    - Nests are woven in trees
    - Webs are spun between branches
    - Burrows are dug in the ground
    - Hives are built on branches
    - Dams are constructed by beavers

    But these are homes, not workshops.

    What about human activity IN a forest?

    - A clearing where you lay out your materials
    - A flat rock where you arrange things
    - A workbench in a forest cabin
    - A table under the trees
```

---

## The Gathering Metaphor

Wait. Let me think about this differently.

Before you arrange, you gather.
You walk the forest floor.
You pick up things that catch your eye.
Pinecones. Flowers. Interesting stones. Feathers.
You bring them back to... somewhere.
You lay them out. You arrange them.

What's that process called?

**Foraging** - but that's taken (domain hunting)

What about the place where you bring things AFTER foraging?

---

## Some Nature Words for "Place of Arrangement"

**Bower** - a sheltered place in a garden, often made of climbing plants
- Bowerbirds create elaborate decorated structures
- A bower is intimate, natural, handcrafted
- "Come to the bower" - a creative retreat

**Glen** - a narrow valley, often secluded
- Quiet, private, tucked away
- A place apart from the main forest

**Glade** - an open space in a forest
- Light comes through
- Room to spread out and work
- "The glade" - where things are created

**Copse** - a small group of trees
- Intimate, sheltered
- But it's trees, not a workspace

**Dell** - a small valley, often with trees
- Cozy, enclosed
- "In the dell"

**Grove** - already taken (it's the whole ecosystem!)

**Hollow** - a sheltered depression
- Could be cozy or eerie
- "The hollow" - where you work in secret

---

## Let Me Try: Bower

```
    🌸 ~~~ BOWER ~~~ 🌸
        /         \
       /  where    \
      /  you       \
     /  arrange    \
    |  beautiful   |
    |  things      |
    |  into scenes |
     \            /
      \   🦋    /
       ~~~~~~~~
```

A bower is where you create beauty.

**Bower** - `grove.place/bower` or `bower.grove.place`

What I like:
- Bowerbirds! They collect colorful objects and arrange them to create beautiful displays
- A bower is a sheltered, beautiful space
- The word itself sounds gentle, natural
- "The bower" - it rolls off the tongue

What gives me pause:
- Does everyone know what a bower is?
- Is it too obscure?
- Bowerbirds are male birds trying to attract mates... is that weird?

Actually, the bowerbird connection is kind of perfect:

> Bowerbirds are famous for their elaborate decorations. The males collect
> colorful objects—berries, flowers, feathers, shells—and arrange them
> carefully to create visually stunning displays.

That's EXACTLY what Terrarium does! You collect Grove's nature elements and arrange them into displays.

---

## Let Me Try: Glade

```
         ☀️ light filters through
              /|\
         ~~~~~/~\~~~~~
        /            \
       /   open       \
      |    space       |
      |    room to     |
      |    create      |
       \             /
        \  🌿 🌺   /
         ~~~~~~~~~
           GLADE
```

A glade is an open space in a forest. Sunlight reaches the floor. There's room to spread out.

**Glade** - `grove.place/glade` or `glade.grove.place`

What I like:
- Simple, everyone knows what it means
- Open, inviting, spacious
- Room to work, to see what you're doing
- Light - you need light to create

What gives me pause:
- Is it too generic?
- "The glade" is a nice phrase, but does it suggest CREATION?
- A glade is passive - it's a place that exists. You don't DO anything there specifically.

---

## Let Me Try: Dell

```
        🌲     🌲     🌲
       /|\   /|\   /|\
       |||   |||   |||
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        \           /
         \  🌸    /
          \  🍄 /
           \  /
            \/
           DELL
       (a cozy dip)
```

A dell is a small, sheltered valley. Often wooded, cozy, tucked away.

**Dell** - `dell.grove.place`

What I like:
- Cozy, intimate
- A little hidden world
- Classic forest word (think "The Farmer in the Dell")
- Feels nostalgic and warm

What gives me pause:
- Is it too... cutesy?
- Dell is also a computer company
- Does it suggest creation?

---

## Wait. Let Me Step Back.

What's the FEELING of using this tool?

```
    You open the canvas.
    There's an empty space.
    On the side, there's a library of components.

    Trees. 🌲 🌳 🌴
    Flowers. 🌸 🌺 🌻
    Creatures. 🦋 🐿️ 🦊
    Elements. ✨ 🍄 🌙

    You drag them onto the canvas.
    You arrange them.
    You resize, rotate, layer.
    You create a scene.

    Then you export it.
    It becomes part of your blog.
    Your header. Your sidebar. Your background.
```

The feeling is:
- Playful
- Creative
- Intentional
- Meditative
- Making something yours

It's like... playing. Arranging. Composing.

---

## The Composition Angle

What if it's not about the PLACE but about the ACT?

**Compose** - to arrange elements into a whole
**Arrange** - to put in order
**Gather** - to collect together
**Weave** - to interlace elements

What are nature words for composition?

A **Tapestry** is woven from many threads...
A **Mosaic** is arranged from many pieces...
A **Bouquet** is gathered flowers...
A **Wreath** is arranged in a circle...

Hmm. These are products, not places.

---

## The Product vs. Place Confusion

I keep going back and forth between:

1. **The place where you create** (Bower, Glade, Dell)
2. **The thing you create** (Terrarium, Tapestry, Scene)
3. **The act of creating** (Compose, Arrange, Weave)

Currently, "Terrarium" is a product name. "You create a terrarium."

But maybe it should be a place name? "You go to the [Place] to create decorations."

Or maybe it should be an action? "You [verb] your decorations."

Let me look at how other Grove services handle this:

- **Foliage** - you customize your foliage (product)
- **Trails** - you create trails (product)
- **Amber** - you store things in amber (place/substance)
- **Ivy** - you send ivy (action/connection)

It's mixed. Some are places, some are products, some are actions.

---

## Revisiting Terrarium

Let me be honest: **Terrarium is actually a pretty good name.**

```
        ╭─────────────────────╮
        │   🌿    🍄    🌸   │
        │  🦋         🌲    │
        │      🪨          │
        │    🌺    ✨      │
        ╰─────────────────────╯
            T E R R A R I U M
         (a little world in glass)
```

**What Terrarium gets right:**
- It's a thing you CREATE - you "build a terrarium"
- It's contained - there are boundaries (the canvas)
- It's curated - you choose each element
- It's a miniature world - exactly what blog decorations are
- It's YOURS - you design it
- It has the "terra" root - earth, ground, nature

**The "sealed under glass" concern:**
- But wait... blog decorations ARE kind of sealed
- Once you export and apply them, they're fixed
- The canvas HAS boundaries - it's not infinite
- The glass could represent the blog's frame

Maybe the "sealed" quality is actually appropriate?

---

## But The Glass Feels Wrong

The thing that bothers me about terrarium:

**Glass creates distance.**

You look AT a terrarium. From outside.
It's a specimen. A display. Separate from you.

Blog decorations should feel like they're YOURS.
Like you're INSIDE them, not observing them.

When I decorate my blog, I'm decorating MY space.
I'm not putting a glass box on my shelf.

---

## What's the Unsealed Version of a Terrarium?

A terrarium is a sealed miniature ecosystem.
What's an OPEN miniature ecosystem?

- A **garden** - you tend it, it grows
- A **planter** - open to the air
- A **rockery** - arranged stones and plants
- A **diorama** - a scene in a box (but that has a window too)

What about just... **Garden**?

---

## Garden

```
         🌸  🌺  🌻
        🌿 🌱 🌿 🌱 🌿
       ╭───────────────╮
       │   GARDEN      │
       │  plant things │
       │  watch them   │
       │  grow         │
       ╰───────────────╯
```

**Garden** - `garden.grove.place`

"You grow your garden. You export it to your blog."

What I like:
- Everyone knows what a garden is
- Gardens are ALIVE, not sealed
- You TEND a garden - ongoing relationship
- "Cultivating your garden" - has a nice ring
- VERY nature-forward

What gives me pause:
- Is it TOO simple? Too obvious?
- Gardens grow over time - but these decorations are static once exported
- A garden is planted in the ground - but this is a canvas
- "The Garden" doesn't feel distinct enough

---

## Let Me Try a Different Approach: What's Unique About Grove's Canvas?

Other decoration builders:
- Canva - generic design tool
- Figma - professional design
- PowerPoint - presentation focused
- Bitmoji scenes - avatar focused

Grove's canvas:
- Nature-themed exclusively
- Curated component library (guardrails)
- Exports to blog decorations
- Part of the Grove ecosystem
- Warm, cozy, intentional

What's DISTINCT about this?

The guardrails. The curation. You can't add anything you want - you choose from Grove's nature palette.

That's actually the OPPOSITE of MySpace chaos.
It's constrained creativity.
It's creativity within a curated world.

---

## Constrained Creativity

What in nature represents "creative freedom within natural boundaries"?

- A **clearing** - open, but bounded by trees
- A **riverbank** - you work with what the river brings
- A **bird's nest** - built from available materials
- A **bonsai** - shaped, but the tree guides you

A **Nest**?

```
         ~~~~~~~~~~~
        /   🌿 🪶   \
       /  🌸    🍂  \
      |   twigs     |
      |   feathers  |
       \  flowers  /
        ~~~~~~~~~~
          N E S T
```

Hmm. A nest is built from gathered materials. It's cozy. It's home.

**Nest** - `nest.grove.place`

But... a nest is for living in. Not for decorating with.
And there's already Nook (private video sharing) which has similar cozy vibes.

---

## Back to Bower

Let me sit with Bower more:

```
    B O W E R

    1. A shelter made of boughs or vines in a garden
    2. A lady's private chamber (archaic)
    3. A bowerbird's decorated display

    "Come to the bower"
    "Build your bower"
    "Your bower awaits"
```

The bowerbird connection is really compelling:

> Male bowerbirds spend HOURS carefully arranging objects.
> They choose items by color, by shine, by shape.
> They create patterns. They adjust constantly.
> The result is a visual display meant to express something.

That's EXACTLY what the creative canvas is for!

And unlike a terrarium (which is sealed, observed):
- A bower is OPEN
- A bower is for INHABITING
- A bower is made WITH nature, not containing nature
- A bower is an EXPRESSION of the builder

---

## Testing: Bower

**The Tagline Test:**
> "Bower is where you _________________."

- Bower is where you compose your world.
- Bower is where you arrange nature into art.
- Bower is where you build something beautiful.

**The User Story:**
> "I went to the Bower and created a forest scene. Now it's my blog header."

**The Vibe:**
- Warm
- Creative
- Intentional
- Playful
- Natural

**Writing the Entry:**

---

## Bower (Draft)

**Creative Canvas** · `bower.grove.place`

Bowerbirds are nature's decorators. The males spend hours gathering colorful objects—berries, flowers, feathers, shells—and arranging them into elaborate displays. Each bower is unique. Each one expresses something about its builder.

Bower is Grove's creative canvas. Drag trees and flowers and creatures onto an open space. Arrange them into scenes. Export what you create as decorations for your blog—headers, sidebars, footers, backgrounds. The component library is your palette: every element is curated from Grove's nature collection. You get creative freedom within the forest's aesthetic.

Build a bower. Make it yours. Let visitors walk into your world.

*Gather, arrange, create.*

---

## Wait. Let Me Also Try: Studio

What if we DON'T use a nature word for this one?

Grove has some human-built elements:
- Porch (a cabin's porch)
- Pantry (a kitchen cupboard)
- Waystone (trail markers)

What about **Studio**?

A studio is where artists work. It's understood. It's direct.

But... it doesn't feel like Grove.
It's too urban.
Too sterile.

What's the forest version of a studio?

---

## The Forest Workshop

In a forest, where would an artist work?

Under the trees.
By a stream.
In a clearing with good light.

But there's no nature word that means "artist's workspace."

Unless...

What about **Canopy**?

```
         🌿🍃🌿🍃🌿🍃🌿
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       /                \
      /    CANOPY        \
     /     the roof       \
    |      where light    |
    |      filters        |
    |      through        |
     \                   /
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

Wait, but canopy is like foliage - it's the visible top layer of a tree. Not quite right.

---

## Let Me Try: Glade (Revisited)

I dismissed Glade earlier, but let me reconsider:

**Glade** - an open space in a forest where sunlight reaches the ground.

What if Glade is the creative canvas because:
- It's open (room to create)
- It has light (you can see what you're doing)
- It's bounded by forest (the guardrails)
- It's a clearing FOR doing things

```
    🌲                           🌲
     \     ☀️ GLADE ☀️        /
      \                       /
       \    open space      /
        \   for creating   /
         \                /
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              floor
```

**Glade** - `glade.grove.place`

> "Step into the Glade. Create your scene."

Hmm. It's not bad, but it feels generic.
A glade is a place you PASS THROUGH.
You don't... do things there specifically.

---

## The Distinction Problem

Many nature words are PLACES, not ACTIVITIES.

- Glade - a place
- Dell - a place
- Hollow - a place
- Glen - a place

But Terrarium and Bower are THINGS you CREATE.

Maybe that's the right distinction:

"You create your **bower**" (a thing)

vs.

"You go to the **glade**" (a place)

Both could work, but they feel different.

---

## Decision Time

Let me compare my top candidates:

### Terrarium
- ✓ It's a thing you create
- ✓ Miniature world - very fitting
- ✓ Curated, intentional arrangement
- ✗ Sealed under glass
- ✗ Observed from outside
- ✗ Static, artificial feeling

### Bower
- ✓ It's a thing you create (or a place)
- ✓ Bowerbird connection - decoration, arrangement
- ✓ Open, not sealed
- ✓ An expression of the builder
- ✓ Warm, natural
- ? Less well-known word
- ? Might sound archaic

### Glade
- ✓ Simple, everyone knows it
- ✓ Open, light-filled
- ✗ A place you pass through, not a thing you make
- ✗ Doesn't suggest creation
- ✗ Generic feeling

### Garden
- ✓ Everyone knows it
- ✓ Alive, tended
- ✗ Too generic
- ✗ Suggests growth over time (but exports are static)
- ✗ Already overused in tech

---

## What If the Name Should Be About the Act?

One more angle: what if it's about what you DO, not where you do it?

- **Arrange** - arrange.grove.place
- **Compose** - compose.grove.place
- **Gather** - gather.grove.place

These are verbs, not nouns. Grove names are mostly nouns.

But wait... **Forage** is arguably a verb-ish name (you forage for domains).

What about **Gather**?

```
    G A T H E R

    You gather elements.
    You gather them into scenes.
    You gather your decorations.

    "Gather your world together."
```

**Gather** - `gather.grove.place`

Hmm. It's nature-aligned. Gathering is what you do in forests.
But it's too vague. Gather what? For what purpose?

---

## I Keep Coming Back to Bower

The more I think about it:

**Bower feels right.**

```
         🌸~~~~~~🌿~~~~~~🌺
        /                   \
       |     B O W E R      |
       |                     |
       |   A place made of   |
       |   gathered things,  |
       |   arranged with     |
       |   intention.        |
       |                     |
        \   🦋    🍂   🪶  /
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

The bowerbird metaphor is too perfect to ignore:
- They GATHER colorful elements
- They ARRANGE them with care
- They CREATE displays
- Each bower is UNIQUE
- It's an EXPRESSION of the builder

And the word itself:
- Sounds gentle, warm
- Evokes shelter, beauty
- Connected to nature without being literal
- Has history (bower in gardens, lady's bower)

---

## Final Comparison: Terrarium vs Bower

| Aspect | Terrarium | Bower |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Metaphor | Sealed world under glass | Bowerbird's decorated display |
| Feeling | Observed | Inhabited |
| Barrier | Glass separates you | Open, you're part of it |
| Association | Specimen, display | Expression, creation |
| Action | "Build a terrarium" | "Build your bower" |
| Root meaning | Terra = earth | Bower = shelter, chamber |

Bower wins for me because it's OPEN, it's EXPRESSION-focused, and it's about BUILDING SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL.

---

## But Wait: Let Me Check One More Thing

The user specifically asked about:
- What IS a creative canvas in forest terms?

A creative canvas is:
- A blank space where you create
- Tools available on the side
- You place things, move them, compose

In forest terms, that's... a clearing? A flat space? A workbench?

But the OUTPUT of using that canvas is:
- A scene you created
- A decoration for your blog
- A mini-world you designed

The output is the bower. The canvas is where you build it.

Maybe the name should emphasize what you're MAKING, not WHERE you're making it.

Terrarium emphasizes the output (a terrarium).
Bower emphasizes the output (your bower).

Both work. But Bower feels more personal, more warm, more open.

---

## The Final Walk

Let me take one more walk through the grove:

```
    I wake up. I want to make my blog beautiful.
    I want decorations - scenes of nature in my header.

    I go to... the Bower.

    The interface opens. An empty canvas.
    On the side: trees, flowers, creatures, elements.
    All from Grove's nature palette.

    I drag a tree onto the canvas.
    I add some flowers at its base.
    A butterfly drifts past.
    Fireflies in the background.
    A mushroom in the corner.

    I'm building my bower.
    Gathering elements. Arranging them.
    Making something mine.

    I export it.
    It becomes my header.

    Visitors to my blog see it:
    "This is their bower. This is their world."
```

Yes. **Bower** is the name.

---

## Summary

**Final name recommendation: Bower**

Terrarium was good, but the "sealed under glass" metaphor creates distance. You observe a terrarium from outside. A bower is something you build, inhabit, and express yourself through.

The bowerbird connection is particularly fitting: these birds are famous for gathering colorful elements and arranging them into unique displays. That's exactly what the creative canvas does.
