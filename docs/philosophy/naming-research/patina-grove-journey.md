## What I Already Know

Patina runs nightly automated backups of every Grove database to cold storage.
Weekly archives compress the daily layers.
Twelve weeks of history remain quietly preserved.

It was called "Cache" before. That didn't fit.
Now it's "Patina."

Let me examine whether that's right.

---

## What IS a Patina?

In the physical world, a patina is:
- The green layer on copper and bronze
- Forms over TIME (years, decades)
- Not decay---PROTECTION
- The thing that saves the Statue of Liberty from corrosion
- Beautiful in its aged way
- Happens without anyone doing anything
- Silent. Invisible until you notice it.

```
    Raw copper       After years
         |               |
         v               v
     [bright]   -->   [green]
     [shiny]          [soft]
     [vulnerable]     [protected]
                      [beautiful]
```

The tagline we have: *"Age as armor. Time as protection."*

That's genuinely beautiful.

---

## Walking Through the Grove...

I enter the grove. My blog is a tree.
I've written posts. Uploaded images. Built something.

Every night, while I sleep, something happens.
My data flows somewhere---copied, preserved, layered.
I don't see it. I don't think about it.
It just... accumulates.

```
                Night 1:    [snapshot]
                Night 2:    [snapshot][snapshot]
                Night 3:    [snapshot][snapshot][snapshot]
                   ...
               Week's end:  [compressed archive]

                         twelve weeks deep
                              |
                              v
                    +-------------------+
                    |                   |
                    |   COLD STORAGE    |
                    |                   |
                    |   (the vault)     |
                    |   (the cellar)    |
                    |   (the depths)    |
                    +-------------------+
```

If disaster strikes---server failure, accidental deletion,
something unthinkable---this silent layer is ALREADY THERE.

It's been building the whole time.

---

## The Metaphor: What Does Patina Capture?

STRONGLY CAPTURES:
- Time-accumulated (builds over days/weeks/months)
- Protective (preserves what's beneath)
- Silent (happens without notice)
- Beautiful (the green of old statues)
- Natural process (no intervention needed)
- Age as armor

```
        Patina on copper:              Patina on Grove:

        [weather]                      [time passing]
        [exposure]                     [nightly runs]
        [years]                        [weeks of archives]
            |                              |
            v                              v
        [protective]                   [protective]
        [beautiful]                    [recoverable]
        [permanent]                    [layered]
```

---

## The Concern: What About RECOVERY?

But here's my hesitation...

A patina is protective, yes. But you don't USE a patina.
You don't INTERACT with it. It just... is.

Backups are for RECOVERY.
Backups are INSURANCE.
Backups are the thing you REACH FOR when everything goes wrong.

```
    Normal day:                    Disaster day:

    You: *doesn't think           You: "Everything is gone!"
         about backups*                 |
         |                              v
         v                         +------------------+
    Patina: *silently              | PATINA, I        |
             accumulating*         | NEED YOU         |
                                   +------------------+
                                            |
                                            v
                                   [restore from archive]
                                   [recovery complete]
                                   [tree lives again]
```

In that moment of crisis... does "Patina" feel like
something you can DEPEND ON?

Or does it feel too... passive?

## Let Me Explore Other Directions

### What Else Accumulates in Nature?

**Rings** - already taken (analytics)

**Resin** - becomes Amber (already taken - storage)

**Bark** - the protective layer on a tree
  - Forms over wounds
  - Thickens with age
  - Protective
  - But you don't REACH FOR bark

**Root Cellar** - where you store preserves
  - Underground
  - Cool, dark
  - Long-term storage
  - Something you GO TO when you need it
  - CELLAR?

**Vault** - too corporate, not forest enough

**Archive** - too generic

---

### The Root Cellar Idea

```
                  The Grove (above ground)
                  🌲  🌳  🌲  🌳  🌲
           ════════════════════════════════
                        |
                        |  stairs down
                        |
                  +-----+-----+
                  |           |
                  |  CELLAR   |  <-- cool, dark, preserved
                  |           |
                  |  [jars]   |  <-- weekly archives
                  |  [jars]   |
                  |  [jars]   |
                  +-----------+
```

A root cellar is:
- Underground (cold storage!)
- Where you keep preserves
- Food that lasts through winter
- Something you actively GO TO when you need it
- Safety against hard times

"When disaster comes, go to the cellar."

Hmm. **Cellar**? `cellar.grove.place`?

*"When the storm comes, everything you need is in the Cellar."*

---

### But Wait...

A cellar is something you GO TO.
But Grove users will never go to this service directly.
They'll never think about it.
The whole point is that it runs silently.

The only time they'll interact with it is through support---
contacting Autumn to say "I need a restore."

So maybe the "passive" quality of Patina is actually RIGHT?

---

## Let Me Try the Tagline Test

Grove names should complete this naturally:

> "Patina is where you _______________."

...that doesn't work. Patina isn't a place.

> "Patina is the _______________."

"Patina is the layer that protects your work over time."
"Patina is the silent backup running every night."
"Patina is the archive you'll never think about until you need it."

That last one is good.

---

## Let Me Try with Cellar

> "Cellar is where you _______________."

"Cellar is where your archives wait for you."

> "Cellar is the _______________."

"Cellar is the underground vault holding twelve weeks of your history."

Hmm. Both work grammatically. But...

---

## The Feeling Check

What FEELING should this service evoke?

- Safety
- Trust
- "I don't have to worry about this"
- Insurance
- "If everything goes wrong, I'm still okay"

**Patina** feels like:
- Beauty
- Age
- Passive protection
- Something that happens TO you (not FOR you)
- Weathered grace

**Cellar** feels like:
- Practical
- Sturdy
- A place to go
- Active storage
- But maybe too utilitarian?

---

## A New Direction: The Tree's Natural Protection

What does a tree do to protect itself?

When a tree is wounded:
- Sap flows to seal the wound
- Bark grows over
- The tree doesn't heal like animals
- It COMPARTMENTALIZES---walls off damage
- New growth covers old wounds

```
         Wound
           |
           v
        [damaged]
           |
           | time + natural process
           v
        [sealed]
        [protected]
        [bark grown over]
        [still there underneath]
        [recoverable if needed]
```

This is called "wound wood" or "callus tissue."

But those are ugly names.

---

## What About RESIN?

Resin flows to protect wounds.
Resin can become amber (taken).
But resin is the PROCESS.

Wait---resin accumulates.
Resin protects.
Resin... drips. Layers. Hardens over time.

But "Resin" sounds sticky and technical.

---

## Back to Patina

Let me really sit with it.

```
                    PATINA

         not decay        protection
             \            /
              \          /
               [        ]
               [ silent ]
               [ layers ]
               [ time   ]
               [ armor  ]
               [        ]
              /          \
             /            \
        happens           beautiful
        naturally         in its age
```

The thing about a patina is: you don't maintain it.
You don't think about it.
It just... IS.

And one day, if something terrible happens,
the patina is why the statue is still standing.
The patina is why the bronze hasn't corroded.

You never thanked the patina.
You never even noticed it.
But it was there the whole time, protecting.

---

## The Recovery Question, Revisited

Does "Patina" capture recovery?

Actually... maybe it doesn't have to.

The backup system isn't about recovery.
Recovery is what YOU do---contacting support, asking for a restore.

The backup system is about PROTECTION.
About the silent work that makes recovery possible.

Patina is the reason you CAN recover.
Patina isn't the recovery itself.

```
        Patina         You hit "contact support"       Recovery
        (the armor)    (asking for help)               (the restore)
            |                    |                          |
            v                    v                          v
        [silent]            [active]                   [result]
        [protective]        [human]                    [restored]
        [ongoing]           [one-time]                 [relief]
```

Patina isn't the restore button.
Patina is the reason there's something TO restore.

---

## The Final Walk

I enter the grove.
I find my tree---my blog, my home.

Beneath me, the root system extends deep.
Mycelium connects me to others.

And around my trunk, over time,
a layer has been forming.
I didn't ask for it. I didn't build it.
It just accumulated, night after night.

```
                    🌲 My Tree
                     ||
                     ||
            .   .    ||    .   .
          .        . || .        .
        .   PATINA   ||   PATINA   .
        .  (layers)  ||  (layers)  .
          .        . || .        .
            .   .    ||    .   .
                     ||
         ════════════||════════════
```

If fire comes---
If lightning strikes---
If someone makes a terrible mistake---

The patina is already there.
It's been building the whole time.
Twelve weeks of quiet protection.

*Age as armor. Time as protection.*

---

## The Verdict

**Patina is the right name.**

It doesn't capture "recovery" because recovery isn't the backup's job.
Recovery is the human act of asking for help (that's Porch).
Recovery is the restore process (that's operational).

Patina captures the ESSENCE:
- Silent
- Protective
- Time-accumulated
- Beautiful
- Unnoticed until you need it
- Already there

The concern about passivity? That IS the point.
You should never think about your backups.
You should never interact with them directly.
They should just... be there. Protecting.

Like the green on an old bronze bell.
Like the soft wear on a cherished book.
Like the marks of time that don't destroy---they preserve.

---

## The Entry (Affirmed)

## Patina
**Backup System** - *Internal service*
**Repository:** [AutumnsGrove/Patina](https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/Patina)

A patina is the thin layer that forms on copper and bronze over time. Not decay, but protection. It's what happens when something weathers the world and comes out stronger. The green of old statues, the warmth of handled wood, the soft wear on a favorite book's spine.

Patina runs nightly automated backups of every Grove database to cold storage. Weekly archives compress the daily layers, and twelve weeks of history remain quietly preserved. You'll probably never think about it---and that's the point. When disaster strikes, Patina is already there, holding everything safe beneath its protective layer.

*Age as armor. Time as protection.*
