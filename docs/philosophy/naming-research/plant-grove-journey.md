# A Journey Through the Grove: Finding the Name for Onboarding

*Scratchpad for exploring what onboarding really IS in this forest*

---

## The Scene: Before Entering

```
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~ THE WORLD OUTSIDE ~~~~~~~~~~~~

                               YOU ARE HERE
                                    |
                                    v
                                  (o_o)
                                   /|\    "I want to write.
                                   / \     I want a space of my own.
                                          I heard about this grove..."

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                               THE EDGE
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                     🌲   🌲   🌲   🌲   🌲   🌲   🌲   🌲
                   🌲   🌳   🌲   🌳   🌲   🌳   🌲   🌳   🌲
                 🌲   🌲   🌲   🌲   🌲   🌲   🌲   🌲   🌲   🌲
                       (somewhere in there is YOUR tree)
                              (you just don't know it yet)
```

---

## The Question I'm Actually Asking

What IS onboarding in forest terms?

Not "where does the signup form go?" but...
What HAPPENS when a new tree appears in a grove?

---

## Let Me Walk Backwards: What IS Onboarding?

The current description says:
> "Signup -> payment -> interactive tour -> handoff to their blog"
> "Gets you publishing within minutes"
> "You arrive as a visitor. You leave with a home."

So it's a JOURNEY. It's:
1. Arriving (you don't have a tree yet)
2. Choosing (where will you be?)
3. Being welcomed (the grove receives you)
4. Getting oriented (how does this place work?)
5. Beginning (you're writing your first post)

That's a lot. It's not just one thing.

---

## What Happens When a New Tree Appears?

In actual forests:

```
         SEED                    SPROUT                   SAPLING
           o                        |                        |
          / \                      /|\                      /|\
         ~~~~~                    ~~~~~                    ~~~~~
         soil                  germination              first growth

    "I exist!"            "I'm reaching up!"        "I can stand!"
```

But wait. In this metaphor, users ARE the trees.
The user doesn't grow from a seed—they BECOME a tree.

This isn't about watching something grow.
This is about BECOMING.

---

## Reframing: What's the User's Experience?

```
    BEFORE                        DURING                      AFTER

    (o_o)  person            ???  ← what happens here?       🌳  tree
     /|\                                                       |
     / \                                                      ~~~

    "I want to write"                                    "This is my space"
```

What's the middle part?

In fantasy terms: a transformation
In forest terms: ???

---

## Looking at How Trees Actually "Arrive"

Trees don't just appear. They come from somewhere.

**Seed + Soil**
A seed lands. It finds the right conditions. It germinates.
- The Seedbed is where seeds are nurtured
- But the USER isn't a seed—they're bringing themselves

**Transplanting**
A young tree is moved from one place to another.
- A nursery is where young trees are cared for before planting
- But we're not moving existing writers... are we?

**Spontaneous growth**
In the right conditions, life emerges.
- Germination is the moment of beginning
- The first crack in the seed coat

**Taking root**
A cutting finds soil and grows roots.
- Roots are the foundation
- "Putting down roots" in a community

---

## Let's Name What "Plant" Currently Implies

**Plant (verb)**
- You plant yourself
- You choose where to grow
- Active agency—YOU do it

But... does the user plant themselves?
Or does the GROVE receive them?

```
          "I plant myself here"          vs.        "I'm welcomed into the grove"
                 ↓                                            ↓
           YOU are active                              GROVE is active
           You choose                                   You're chosen for
           It's YOUR effort                            It's a gift
```

The Grove's whole philosophy is warm and welcoming.
"Plant" might be too... effortful?

---

## Alternative Framings

### The ARRIVAL Frame

What if onboarding is about ARRIVING, not planting?

```
                    ~ ~ ~ THE GROVE ENTRANCE ~ ~ ~

                         ___________
                        |   GATE    |
                        |  welcome  |
                        |___________|
                             | |
                    .........| |.........
                   🌲  🌲  🌲 | | 🌲  🌲  🌲
                  🌲  🌲  🌲  | |  🌲  🌲  🌲
                           THE PATH
```

Names in this frame:
- **Gate** - where you enter (but gates exclude too)
- **Threshold** - the moment of crossing (already a pattern name!)
- **Path** - the way in
- **Arrival** - the experience itself

### The NURTURING Frame

What if onboarding is about being NURTURED into existence?

```
                      ~ ~ ~ THE SEEDBED ~ ~ ~

                    .-----------------------.
                   |  ☀️ warmth             |
                   |  💧 water              |
                   |  🌱 🌱 🌱 tiny seedlings |
                   |  rich soil, protection  |
                    '------------------------'

            "We nurture you until you're ready to grow"
```

Names in this frame:
- **Seedbed** - where seeds are started (current internal name)
- **Nursery** - where young plants are tended
- **Hothouse** - accelerated growth (too industrial?)
- **Greenhouse** - protected beginning space

### The BECOMING Frame

What if onboarding is about TRANSFORMATION?

```
    PERSON                   ???                     TREE

    (o_o)          ~ magical forest moment ~          🌳
     /|\           leaves swirl around you             |
     / \           roots grow from your feet          ~~~
    ground         bark forms on your skin          ground
```

This is more fantasy than nature...
But it IS what happens emotionally.

Names in this frame:
- **Grove magic** - nope, too whimsical
- **Rooting** - the moment roots form
- **First Light** - dawn of your existence here
- **Sprouting** - emergence from potential to actual

### The BELONGING Frame

What if onboarding is about BELONGING somewhere?

```
                    THE GROVE COMMUNITY

            🌳  🌲  🌳  🌲  🌳  🌲  🌳
               🌲  🌳  🌲  🌳  🌲  🌳

                       [empty spot]
                           ↑
                    "This one's yours"
```

Names in this frame:
- **Nesting** - finding your place
- **Settling** - putting down roots
- **Claiming** - this spot is yours

---

## Wait. Let Me Ask a Different Question.

What does it FEEL LIKE to arrive in the grove for the first time?

```
                              ☀️
                             /|\
                       ~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~
                      ~/      |   ⭐  \~
                     ~/  ⭐   |        \~
                    ~/ CANOPY   ⭐      \~
                    ~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~
                            |
                    🌲      |      🌲
                     \\     |     //
                      \\    |    //
                       🌲   |   🌲
                            |
                    ........|........
                            ↑
                      YOU WALK IN

                      It's quiet.
                      Light filters through leaves.
                      There's a path.
                      Someone has been here before—
                      but right now, it's just you.

                      You take a breath.

                      "I'm here."
```

That moment of "I'm here"—what IS that?

---

## The Feeling Inventory

When a new user goes through onboarding, they should feel:

1. **Welcome** - not scrutinized, not challenged
2. **Oriented** - not lost, not overwhelmed
3. **Excited** - not bored, not anxious
4. **Grounded** - connected to something real
5. **READY** - prepared to begin

What natural process has those feelings?

---

## Germination?

```
         BEFORE                  DURING                   AFTER

           o  (seed)           crack                     🌱 (sprout)
          ~~~                 ~/ \~                      ~~~
         dark                 light                      growing
         waiting              awakening                  beginning
         potential            becoming                   actual
```

Germination is:
- The moment potential becomes actual
- When conditions are right, something awakens
- The first emergence into light

**Germinate** as a name?
- germinate.grove.place
- "Where seeds become saplings"
- "The moment of beginning"

But "germinate" is... clinical? Scientific?
It doesn't feel WARM.

---

## Let Me Try: Nursery

```
                    ~ ~ ~ THE NURSERY ~ ~ ~

              .------------------------------.
             |                                |
             |  🌱  🌱  🌱  🌱  🌱  🌱  🌱  🌱   |
             |                                |
             |  Young seedlings in neat rows  |
             |  Protected from harsh weather  |
             |  Tended by careful hands       |
             |                                |
              '------------------------------'
                          ↓
                    When ready...
                          ↓
                  🌳  🌲  🌳  🌲  🌳
                     THE GROVE
```

A nursery is:
- Where young plants are grown before transplanting
- A protected, nurturing space
- Temporary—you LEAVE it

**Nursery** as a name?
- nursery.grove.place
- "Where new trees begin"
- "Nurture before growth"

Hmm. I like "nursery" but there's a problem:
The onboarding flow is FAST. "Gets you publishing within minutes."
A nursery implies time, patience, slow growth.
This is more like... immediate transformation.

---

## What About the Action vs. Place Question?

Current name: **Plant** (verb)
- "plant.grove.place"
- You go there to plant yourself
- It's about YOUR action

Alternative: **Seedbed** (noun, place)
- "seedbed.grove.place"
- You're nurtured in the seedbed
- It's about WHERE you begin

Alternative: **Nursery** (noun, place)
- "nursery.grove.place"
- You're cared for in the nursery
- It's about WHERE you grow

Which is more Grove-like?

Looking at existing names:
- **Places**: Meadow, Nook, Clearing, Pantry
- **Processes/Objects**: Bloom, Patina, Amber
- **Actions (verbs as nouns)**: Forage

"Plant" is unusual—it's a verb used as a destination.
"Come to plant" = "come to do this action"

Actually... that's interesting.
Forage is also a verb. "Come to forage."
Plant is the same. "Come to plant."

---

## Let Me Test the Taglines

**Plant**
- "Plant is where you put down roots."
- "Plant yourself in the grove."

**Seedbed**
- "Seedbed is where new trees begin."
- "Start in the seedbed, grow into the grove."

**Nursery**
- "Nursery is where you're welcomed and nurtured."
- "Every great tree started in the nursery."

**Germinate**
- "Germinate is the moment you become."
- (doesn't feel right as a noun)

---

## Actually, Let Me Question "Plant" More Deeply

"Plant" has a second meaning:
- To plant (verb): to put in soil
- A plant (noun): a living thing

So "plant.grove.place" could mean:
- "The place to plant yourself"
- "The place of the plant" (???)

That's confusing.

Also: "plant" as a noun is... industrial?
"The plant" = "the factory"
That's a bad connotation.

---

## What About ROOTS?

```
                        🌳
                         |
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                         |
                     ┌───┴───┐
                   ┌─┘       └─┐
                 ┌─┘           └─┐
               ┌─┘               └─┐
              ─┘    THE ROOTS      └─

       "This is where you connect to the grove"
```

Roots are:
- The foundation
- The first thing that forms
- What anchors you to a place
- What connects you to the network (mycelium)

**Roots** as a name?
- roots.grove.place
- "Where you put down roots"
- "Connect to the grove"

But "roots" is already conceptually tied to Mycelium...
And the mycelium IS the root network.

---

## Hmm. Let Me Walk Through This Again.

I'm a person. I've heard about Grove. I want my own blog.

```
                        THE JOURNEY

    [OUTSIDE]                              [INSIDE THE GROVE]
         |                                         |
         |    ┌─────────────────────────┐          |
         |    │                         │          |
         ├───>│  ??? ONBOARDING ???     │────────> 🌳 MY TREE
         |    │                         │          |
         |    └─────────────────────────┘          |
         |                                         |
    "I want to write"                     "I'm home"
```

What IS that middle box?

It's not really a place I stay in.
It's more like... a process I go through.
A transition.
A passage.

---

## PASSAGE!

Wait. What about the concept of PASSAGE?

```
         OUTSIDE              THE PASSAGE              INSIDE

           .                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~                🌳
          /|\                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~                 |
           |                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~                ~~~
           |                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        ~~~|~~~               ~~~~~~~~~~~~

                         "You walk through"
```

A passage is:
- A way through
- A transitional space
- Brief—you don't stay
- Transformative—you're different on the other side

But "passage" is... generic?
Not nature-y enough.

---

## What About FIRST LIGHT?

The first light of dawn.
The moment darkness becomes day.
When you can finally see.

```
                      ☀️ ← rising
                     /|\
                ----/--|--\----
                   /   |   \
                  /    |    \
                 /     |     \
        DARKNESS      |      THE GROVE
                      |
                    DAWN
```

**First Light** / **Dawn** as a name?
- firstlight.grove.place
- dawn.grove.place
- "The moment you begin to see"
- "When your writing life starts"

I like the FEELING of this.
But it might be too abstract?

## Let Me Consider: What's ACTUALLY Happening in Onboarding?

Step by step:

1. **Signup** - you say who you are
2. **Payment** - you commit (even if free tier)
3. **Username selection** - you choose your identity
4. **Interactive tour** - you learn the space
5. **First post** - you begin writing
6. **Handoff** - you're in your own tree

So you're:
- Declaring yourself
- Committing
- Choosing an identity
- Orienting
- Creating
- Being

That's a LOT for one name to capture.

---

## Maybe "Plant" IS Right, But Let Me Be Sure

**Arguments FOR "Plant":**
- It's a verb—active, you do something
- "Plant yourself" = commit, put down roots
- Simple, short, memorable
- .grove.place/plant feels natural
- The action matches the outcome

**Arguments AGAINST "Plant":**
- "Plant" as noun = factory (bad connotation)
- Implies effort/work more than welcome
- Doesn't capture the nurturing aspect
- "Seedbed" was the internal name—why change?

**Arguments FOR "Seedbed":**
- Where seeds are started—nurturing, protected
- Implies care and attention
- Matches "seedlings" becoming "trees"
- Has warmth

**Arguments AGAINST "Seedbed":**
- Longer (two syllables vs. one)
- Implies staying a while (seedlings need time)
- Might feel too... gardener-perspective?
- The USER isn't a seed—they're becoming a tree

---

## A New Direction: What If It's About WELCOMING?

The Grove is about warmth. Belonging. Coming home.

What if onboarding is fundamentally about BEING WELCOMED?

```

            "Step into the light. You're home."
```

Names in this frame:
- **Welcome** - "welcome.grove.place" (too generic)
- **Hearth** - warmth, home (but Fireside uses fire imagery)
- **Threshold** - the doorway (already a pattern!)
- **Haven** - safe harbor (nice but maybe too passive)

---

## Wait. HAVEN.

A haven is:
- A place of safety
- Where you're protected
- Where you can rest and begin again
- A harbor for ships (forest version: a harbor for travelers)

```

         |    You've been wandering the internet.   |
         |    Shouting into the algorithm void.     |
         |    Looking for somewhere to BE.          |
         |                                          |

```

**Haven** as a name?
- haven.grove.place
- "Find your haven in the grove"
- "A place to begin again"

Hmm. It's nice but... it's not specifically about BEGINNING.
It's more about SAFETY.
And Grove already has safety themes elsewhere (Shade, Patina).

---

## Let Me Try Combining Concepts

What if the name captures BOTH:
- The action of beginning
- The feeling of welcome

**Sprout**
- sprout.grove.place
- "Where you sprout"
- The first visible sign of growth
- Active AND nurtured

```
                        SPROUT

                          🌱
                         /|\
                        ~~~

              "The first sign that you're growing"
```

**Sprout** is:
- The moment a seed becomes visible
- Something happening!
- Growth just beginning
- Hopeful, tender, exciting

But... is it too cutesy?
Does it sound like a kids' product?

---

## Comparing the Top Contenders

Let me actually compare:

| Name | Domain | Meaning | Feeling | Issue |
|------|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| **Plant** | plant.grove.place | You plant yourself | Active, decisive | "Plant" as noun = factory |
| **Seedbed** | seedbed.grove.place | Where seeds are nurtured | Warm, protected | Implies slow growth |
| **Nursery** | nursery.grove.place | Where young plants are cared for | Nurturing, safe | Too... pediatric? |
| **Sprout** | sprout.grove.place | First visible growth | Exciting, hopeful | Maybe cutesy |
| **Haven** | haven.grove.place | Safe harbor | Protected, restful | Not about beginning |

---

## Actually, Wait. Let Me Reconsider "Seedbed"

The current internal name is "Seedbed."
It was changed to "Plant" for the public name.

Why?

Maybe because "Plant" is:
- Shorter
- More action-oriented
- Feels more like "you do something"

But Seedbed is where the GROVE takes care of you.
That's more on-brand.

```
                    ~ ~ ~ THE SEEDBED ~ ~ ~

    .----------------------------------------------------.
   |                                                      |
   |   ☀️  warm light                                     |
   |   💧  gentle water                                   |
   |   🌱  🌱  🌱  tiny beginnings                         |
   |                                                      |
   |   "You arrive as a seed of possibility.             |
   |    We nurture you into readiness.                   |
   |    When you're ready, you grow into the grove."     |
   |                                                      |
    '----------------------------------------------------'
```

The metaphor works:
1. You arrive at the seedbed (signup)
2. You're prepared (payment, setup)
3. You're nurtured (tour, orientation)
4. You sprout into your own space (first post, handoff)

---

## But "Seedbed" Has a Problem

The onboarding is FAST. "Publishing within minutes."

A seedbed implies patience, time, gradual nurturing.
That's a mismatch.

Unless...

What if the FEELING is nurturing, but the PACE is quick?
Like a magical seedbed that works instantly?

In the Grove, things can be both:
- Bloom is brief but brilliant
- Patina builds over time
- Both are valid

Maybe Seedbed captures the CARE, not the DURATION.

---

## Testing the Sentence

"[Name] is where you _______________."

- **Plant** is where you put down roots.
- **Seedbed** is where you're nurtured into the grove.
- **Nursery** is where you grow until you're ready.
- **Sprout** is where you begin to grow.

Which feels most Grove-like?

Reading the naming doc again:
> "You arrive as a visitor. You leave with a home."

That's about TRANSFORMATION.
Coming in as one thing, leaving as another.

---

## The Transformation Question

What best captures "visitor -> tree owner"?

```
    BEFORE           NAME           AFTER

    (o_o)            ???             🌳
    visitor                         resident
    seeker                          owner
    potential                       actual
```

**Plant** captures: You do the planting
**Seedbed** captures: You're nurtured into growth
**Sprout** captures: You emerge as something new

---

## Actually, I Think I've Been Overcomplicating This

Let me step back.

The user does ONE thing at plant.grove.place:
They CREATE THEIR BLOG.

That's it. Signup, payment, setup, boom—you have a blog.

What's that in forest terms?

**Planting a tree.**

You don't BECOME a tree. You PLANT one.
Your blog is your tree.
You're the one who plants it and tends it.

```
                        YOU
                       (o_o)
                        /|\    "I plant my tree here"
                        / \
                         |
                         v
                        🌱 → 🌳
                      YOUR BLOG
```

In this framing:
- The user is the GARDENER, not the tree
- The blog is the tree
- Planting is the act of creation

That's actually consistent with "Plant."

---

## But Wait—The Naming Doc Says:

> "A forest of voices. Every user is a tree in the grove."

So users ARE trees, not gardeners of trees.

Hmm. Mixed metaphor alert.

Let me look at how other services handle this:

- **Meadow** - users gather there (users are people walking in meadow)
- **Rings** - users check their growth (users are trees with rings)
- **Foliage** - users customize their look (users are trees with foliage)
- **Heartwood** - users have a core identity (users are trees with heartwood)

So sometimes users are PEOPLE in the forest,
And sometimes users ARE the trees.

The metaphor is fluid.

---

## Okay, Landing on Something

Given all of this, here's what I think:

**"Plant" works** because:
- It's the action of beginning
- It works whether you're "planting yourself" or "planting your blog"
- It's short, memorable, clear
- "plant.grove.place" flows well
- The verb-as-destination pattern matches Forage

**BUT** there's still the "plant = factory" problem.

Let me test: if someone says "go to Plant," what do they picture?
- A growing thing? (good)
- A factory? (bad)
- The act of planting? (okay)

In the context of "plant.grove.place," the factory meaning is unlikely.
Grove context makes "plant" clearly about growing things.

---

## My Hesitation

Something still nags at me.

"Plant" is about what YOU do.
But Grove's philosophy is about what the GROVE does for you.

The Porch journey discovered this:
> Support isn't about SENDING something.
> It's about SITTING WITH someone.

By analogy:
> Onboarding isn't about PLANTING yourself.
> It's about being WELCOMED into the grove.

What if the name should reflect the GROVE'S action, not yours?

---

## Grove-Centric Names

If the grove is doing the welcoming, the name might be:

- **Welcome** - the grove welcomes you (too generic)
- **Entrance** - the grove's entrance (too architectural)
- **Opening** - where the grove opens for you (interesting...)
- **Clearing** - already taken (status page)
- **Glade** - a sunny opening in the forest

**GLADE?**

```
                    ~ ~ ~ THE GLADE ~ ~ ~

                         ☀️
                        /|\
              🌲  🌲  🌲  |  🌲  🌲  🌲
             🌲        ~~~|~~~        🌲
            🌲     sunny opening      🌲
           🌲          here           🌲
          🌲     you enter the        🌲
         🌲         grove             🌲
        🌲                             🌲
       🌲                               🌲
```

A glade is:
- An open space in a forest
- Where sunlight reaches the ground
- A natural entrance point
- A clearing for new growth

But... "Glade" sounds like "Blade" or "Glad."
And it's similar to "Clearing" (status page).

---

## Okay. Decision Time.

I've walked through a LOT. Let me summarize where I actually land:

### The Core Tension

**Plant** = You plant yourself (user-active)
**Seedbed** = You're nurtured by the grove (grove-active)

Both are valid. Both fit the metaphor.

### My Recommendation

Keep **Plant** as the public name, but with a refined understanding:

```
                    ~ ~ ~ PLANT ~ ~ ~

    Plant is where you put down roots in the grove.

                         🌱
                        /|\
                       ~~~~
                       soil

    It's not about effort—it's about CHOOSING.
    You choose to be here.
    You plant yourself.
    The grove does the rest.
```

The tagline should emphasize ARRIVAL, not effort:
> "Plant yourself. The grove takes root."
> "Choose where you grow."
> "You arrive as a visitor. You leave with a home."

### Alternative: If "Plant" Feels Wrong

If the "factory" connotation or the "effort" framing bothers you,
consider **Seedbed** as the public name after all:

```
                    ~ ~ ~ SEEDBED ~ ~ ~

    Seedbed is where the grove welcomes new growth.

                       🌱 🌱 🌱
                      ~~~~~~~~~~
                      prepared soil

    You don't work here—you're CARED for here.
    The seedbed nurtures you into readiness.
    When you emerge, you're home.
```

Domain: seedbed.grove.place
Tagline: "Where new trees begin."

---

## Final Thoughts

The naming philosophy says:
> "The Grove is the place. These are the things you find there."

Plant is something you DO in the grove.
Seedbed is something you FIND in the grove.

Both work. But Grove services lean toward THINGS:
- Meadow (place)
- Pantry (place)
- Amber (object)
- Ivy (living thing)

"Plant" as a verb-noun is the exception, not the rule.
"Seedbed" fits the pattern better.

But "Plant" is already claimed, already in use, already documented.
And it WORKS.

---

## The Landing

**Keep Plant.**

But update the description to be more welcoming, less effort-y:

> ## Plant
> **Onboarding** - `plant.grove.place`
>
> A seedbed is where seeds are planted and nurtured until they're
> ready to grow on their own. Carefully prepared soil, the right
> conditions, gentle care until roots take hold.
>
> Plant is how new trees join the grove. You arrive as a visitor
> with something to say. You're welcomed, oriented, and given a
> space to grow. Within minutes, you're home. Within moments,
> you're writing.
>
> *You arrive as a visitor. You leave with a home.*

The internal name "Seedbed" remains perfect for development context—
it reminds developers that this is about NURTURING, not just processing.

---

## Alternative Ending: The Case for Switching to Seedbed

If this exploration made you doubt "Plant," here's the case for switching:

| Aspect | Plant | Seedbed |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Metaphor | Verb-as-noun (exception) | Noun (fits pattern) |
| Action | User plants | Grove nurtures |
| Feeling | Decisive, effortful | Welcoming, caring |
| Domain | plant.grove.place | seedbed.grove.place |
| Connotation risk | Factory | None |

The change would be:
- Public name: Seedbed (not Plant)
- Internal name: Seedbed (same)
- Domain: seedbed.grove.place
- Tagline: "Where new trees begin"

It's a small change. But it might feel MORE right.
