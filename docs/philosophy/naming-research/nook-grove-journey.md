# A Journey Through the Grove

*Scratchpad for exploring the name of private video sharing*

                        (mycelium network)
```

---

## The Starting Point: Nook

Currently this is called **Nook**. Let me examine what that means.

A nook is:
- A tucked-away corner
- A quiet space set apart
- Somewhere intimate and private
- Small, cozy, sheltered

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                         │
    │      Main Room                          │
    │                                         │
    │               ┌──────────┐              │
    │               │          │              │
    │               │   NOOK   │ <-- tucked   │
    │               │ (cozy)   │     away     │
    │               └──────────┘              │
    │                                         │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Nook feels like a *place*—a small alcove where you go to be apart.

But wait. What IS this thing we're naming?

---

## What IS Private Video Sharing?

Let me think about what this product actually does:

1. **You have videos** (moments captured)
2. **You want to share them** (not hoard them)
3. **With specific people** (not the world)
4. **With privacy features** (faces blurred, local processing)

The key verbs are:
- SHARING (showing to others)
- WATCHING (viewing content together)
- GATHERING (a small group comes together)
- PROTECTING (privacy, blurring, control)

```
         You (have videos)
              |
              | share
              v
    ┌─────────────────────┐
    │                     │
    │   Small friend      │
    │   group gathers     │
    │   to WATCH          │
    │                     │
    └─────────────────────┘
              |
              | videos are
              v
    ┌─────────────────────┐
    │                     │
    │   PROTECTED         │
    │   - faces blurred   │
    │   - local process   │
    │   - you choose who  │
    │                     │
    └─────────────────────┘
```

---

## The Tension I'm Feeling

**Nook emphasizes:**
- The SPACE (tucked away)
- The PRIVACY (hidden)
- The COZINESS (intimate)
- The SMALLNESS (few people)

**But video sharing involves:**
- SHOWING (visual content going outward)
- AUDIENCE (small but present—people watching)
- MEDIA (videos, moving images)
- GATHERING (coming together to view)

Does "nook" capture the WATCHING?
Does "nook" capture the GATHERING?
Does "nook" feel like a THEATER more than a CORNER?

---

## Walking Through the Forest...

I enter the grove.

I pass the **Meadow** where everyone gathers in sunlight—too public.
I walk by **Outpost** where friends play games at the edge—too active.
I see **Pantry** where provisions are stored—too transactional.

I have videos of a trip with friends. Birthday moments. The silly afternoon.
I want to share these with three people. Not the world. Not forever. Just... us.

Where do I go?

I could go to a **nook**—a tucked corner where we sit close.
But we're not just sitting. We're *watching something together*.

In a forest, where do small groups gather to watch something?

---

## What Happens in Nature When Small Groups Watch?

In real life, when a few people gather to watch something:

- Around a campfire (watching flames, telling stories)
- In a den (cozy animal gathering place)
- In a cave (ancient projection on walls)
- A screening in a small room (but that's buildings, not forest)
- Gathered at a clearing looking at the moon
- Huddled looking at something on the ground

```
        🔥 CAMPFIRE
       /   \
      👤   👤
     watching something together
     (flames, stories, shared focus)
```

The campfire model is interesting. You don't stare at each other.
You all face the same direction—toward the THING.
The thing is the content. The fire. The story. The video.

---

## Campfire? Ember? Flame?

**Campfire** - gathering around something warm and luminous
- Too long as a domain name
- But the concept is right: gathered around a glowing thing

**Ember** - the warm glow that remains
- But Amber is already taken (storage)
- Too close phonetically

**Flame** - the flickering light
- Kind of aggressive
- Not cozy enough

**Flicker** - the dancing light, like old film
- Video connection! Films flicker!
- But also means "unstable"

Hmm.

---

## What About DEN?

A den is where animals gather together for warmth and safety.
Fox den. Bear den. The family gathering spot.

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                   ___                   │
    │                  /   \                  │
    │                 /     \                 │
    │                | DEN   |                │
    │                |  ~~~  |                │
    │                 \     /                 │
    │                  \___/                  │
    │                                         │
    │  A cozy underground space where the     │
    │  pack gathers together                  │
    │                                         │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

A den is:
- Private (underground, hidden)
- Cozy (warm, safe)
- For family/close group (the pack)
- A GATHERING place (not solitary)

"Share it in the Den"
"Gather in the Den"

den.grove.place

---

## Den vs Nook

| Quality | Den | Nook |
|---------|-----|------|
| Privacy | Underground, hidden | Tucked away corner |
| Gathering | Pack comes together | More solitary feel |
| Purpose | Living together | Reading/being alone |
| Warmth | Yes, body heat | Yes, cozy |
| Activity | Social, active | Quiet, still |
| Feels like... | Family movie night | Reading in a corner |

Den has more of a GATHERING energy.
Nook has more of a SOLITARY energy.

For video sharing WITH others... Den might fit better?

---

## But Wait—Let Me Question Den

Problems with Den:
- "Den" can feel dark, cave-like (is that bad? videos are dark rooms...)
- Den of thieves / den of iniquity (negative associations)
- Too animalistic? Does it fit the Grove vibe?

Reading the Grove naming philosophy again...

> "These names share common ground: nature, shelter, things that grow. But none of them are *about* trees directly. They're about what happens in and around the forest."

Den is definitely nature. It happens in forests. Animals make dens.
But it's not about trees—it's about the creatures who live there.

Is that okay? Let me check existing names:
- Outpost (structure at forest edge)
- Pantry (room in a cabin)
- Porch (part of a cabin)
- Meadow (clearing in forest)
- Clearing (open space)

These are all places in/around the forest, not the trees themselves.
Den would fit that pattern.

---

## What About the VIDEO Aspect?

Neither Nook nor Den really captures the VIDEO/VISUAL element.

What in nature is about watching? Viewing? Screens?

- Watching: Observatory, Vista, Lookout
- But Vista is already taken (infrastructure monitoring)

What if it's not about watching but about SHOWING?

- Lantern (projects light)
- Projection (shadow puppets on cave walls)
- Theater (but too human-made)

Cave paintings! The original video sharing!

    │                                         │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

What if we called it **Grotto**?

---

## GROTTO

A grotto is a small cave or cavern—often with water, often beautiful.
Natural cathedrals. Hidden chambers. A secret showing-space.

```
         ___________________
        /                   \
       /      GROTTO         \
      |    ▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒       |
      |    ▒ screen? ▒       |
      |    ▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒       |
      |                      |
      |   👤  👤  👤         |
      |   gathered watching  |
       \____________________/
```

A grotto is:
- Hidden (private, not public)
- Beautiful (grottos are often magical feeling)
- Enclosed (small group fits, not infinite)
- Natural (formed by water and time)
- A destination (you go there intentionally)

"Share it in the Grotto"
grotto.grove.place

Hmm. It has the VIDEO feel—like a small screening room.
It has the PRIVATE feel—hidden, enclosed.
It has the GATHERING feel—a destination for a few people.

But is it too... dramatic? Too grand?

---

## Let Me Try Taglines

**Nook**: *"Gather close. Share quietly."*
- Emphasizes intimacy and privacy
- Doesn't capture the watching/visual aspect

**Den**: *"Share with your pack."*
- Emphasizes the close group
- Animal/family energy
- Still doesn't capture video specifically

**Grotto**: *"A hidden theater for your closest friends."*
- Captures the screening room aspect
- Captures the privacy
- But "theater" is too human...

**Grotto**: *"Project your moments on the cave wall."*
- Too poetic? Too weird?

---

## Actually, What's the Core Feeling?

When I imagine using this product, what do I feel?

```
    You just got back from a weekend trip with 4 friends.
    You have a bunch of video clips.
    Some have strangers in the background (auto-blurred).

    You want to share these with JUST those 4 people.

    Not social media. Not forever. Not the world.
    Just... a cozy place to show what you captured.

    Like gathering on a couch with friends,
    phone held out, saying "look at this one!"
```

The feeling is:
- Casual but intentional
- Private but social (just us)
- Ephemeral maybe? Or persistent but hidden?
- Like a group chat but for video

---

## What If It's About the Gathering, Not the Space?

What if the name isn't about WHERE you are but about WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

- Showing (too generic)
- Screening (too formal)
- Sharing (too generic)
- Gathering (already used in Meadow energy)
- Watching (passive)
- Viewing (clinical)

What if it's about the MOMENT of coming together?

---

## Fireside (Already Conceptually Taken)

Fireside is already a mode of Wisp (talking through writer's block).
But the concept is perfect for video:

Gathered around the fire, watching the flames, sharing stories...
But with videos instead of flames.

Can't use Fireside though.

---

## What About HOLLOW?

A hollow is:
- A tree hollow (cozy, hidden, protective)
- A small valley (sheltered, gathered)
- An enclosed space

```
         🌲
        /   \
       | ░░░ |
       | ░░░ |  <-- hollow in the tree
       | ░░░ |      small, hidden, yours
        \   /
         | |
         | |
```

"Share in the Hollow"
hollow.grove.place

A hollow is:
- Part of a tree (fits the Grove metaphor perfectly)
- Hidden (you have to know it's there)
- Small (only fits a few)
- Cozy (animals nest there, safe)
- Yours (you claimed this hollow)

But "hollow" can also mean empty...

---

## Let Me Return to NOOK and Really Question It

The current name is Nook. Let me really sit with it.

**What I like about Nook:**
- Immediately feels cozy
- Clearly private/tucked away
- Short, memorable
- Easy to say

**What worries me about Nook:**
- Feels solitary (a reading nook is for ONE person)
- Doesn't capture video/visual element
- Doesn't capture gathering/sharing element
- Feels passive (you sit in a nook) not active (you share/watch)

But wait—is the solitary concern valid?

A breakfast nook is for a family.
A nook in a restaurant is for a small group.

Nooks can be for small groups, not just individuals.

---

## Testing The Tagline

> "Nook is where you _______________."

- Nook is where you share videos with your closest friends.
- Nook is where you gather to watch, away from the world.
- Nook is where your moments stay private.

> "Den is where you _______________."

- Den is where you share with your pack.
- Den is where family gathers to watch.
- Den is where videos stay with the people who matter.

> "Hollow is where you _______________."

- Hollow is where you tuck away what matters.
- Hollow is where your moments are protected.
- Hollow is where small groups gather in the tree.

> "Grotto is where you _______________."

- Grotto is where you screen your memories.
- Grotto is where friends gather in the hidden chamber.

---

## A New Thought: BOWER

A bower is:
- A shelter made of branches and vines
- A secluded spot in a garden
- A lady's private room (archaic)
- A nest or retreat

```
     🌿 ~~~~ 🌿 ~~~~ 🌿
      ~~~~~ 🌿 ~~~~~

       │  BOWER  │
       │ ~~~~~~~ │
       │ 👤 👤👤 │
       ╰─────────╯
        sheltered by
        living walls
```

"Gather in the Bower"
bower.grove.place

A bower is:
- Organic (made of living things)
- Sheltered (protected from outside)
- Private (secluded, hidden)
- Beautiful (bower birds decorate theirs!)
- A destination (you go there intentionally)

This is interesting. Bower birds are famous for:
- Creating beautiful spaces
- DISPLAYING visual things to attract/impress
- The VISUAL/SHOWING aspect!

---

## Actually, Bower Has Promise...

Bower captures:
- Privacy (secluded)
- Beauty (decorated, curated)
- VISUAL DISPLAY (bower birds show off!)
- Gathering (small space for few)
- Organic/natural (fits Grove perfectly)

    │                                         │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

*"Bower is your private gallery for the people who matter."*

Hmm. Gallery implies still images though. Videos?

*"Bower is where you screen your moments for the few who matter."*

---

## Let Me Compare the Finalists

| Name | Privacy | Gathering | Visual/Video | Grove Fit | Feel |
|------|---------|-----------|--------------|-----------|------|
| Nook | Strong | Weak | None | Good | Cozy but solitary |
| Den | Strong | Strong | None | Good | Pack, family |
| Hollow | Strong | Medium | None | Great (tree!) | Hidden, yours |
| Bower | Strong | Medium | Strong! | Great | Curated, beautiful |
| Grotto | Strong | Strong | Medium | Good | Hidden theater |

**Bower** has the unique advantage of capturing the VISUAL/DISPLAY aspect through the bower bird metaphor.

**Den** has the strongest GATHERING energy.

**Nook** is simplest and already established but weakest on gathering and visual.

---

## The Bower Bird Connection

Let me think about this more...

A bower bird:
1. Creates a private space (the bower)
2. Decorates it beautifully (visual curation)
3. SHOWS things to visitors (display, presentation)
4. Only invites specific others in (selective, private)

This is EXACTLY what private video sharing is!

1. You create a private space (your video collection)
2. You curate what goes there (your moments)
3. You SHOW videos to visitors (screening, sharing)
4. Only your chosen friends can enter (privacy)

*"Build your bower. Invite who matters."*

---

## But Wait—Is Bower Too Obscure?

Most people don't know what a bower is.
They might think "Jack Bower" or "bower" like bowing.

Nook is universally understood.
Den is universally understood.

Bower requires explanation.

Is that bad for Grove? Let me check other Grove names...

- Lattice (common enough)
- Mycelium (obscure—the fungal network)
- Patina (somewhat obscure—the protective layer)
- Wisp (common but the will-o'-the-wisp connection is obscure)
- Trove (common)
- Aria (common)

Some Grove names require learning. That's okay.
The explanation is part of the charm.

---

## Trying a Different Angle: What If We Keep Nook?

Maybe Nook is fine. Let me argue FOR it:

**The Nook argument:**
- "Come into my nook" = I'm inviting you into my private space
- Nooks CAN be for small groups (breakfast nook)
- The simplicity is a feature
- The video aspect comes from the CONTENT, not the name
- Ivy isn't about vines—it's about connection. Nook doesn't need to be about video.

**The Nook tagline already works:**
> *"Gather close. Share quietly."*

Maybe I'm overthinking this. Names don't have to describe the product literally. They evoke a FEELING.

Nook evokes: cozy, private, tucked away, intimate.
Those feelings ARE right for private video sharing.

---

## Actually, What If the Name Isn't About Video?

Looking at other Grove names:
- Meadow isn't about grass—it's about open social gathering
- Amber isn't about fossils—it's about preserving
- Bloom isn't about flowers—it's about brief, purposeful appearance

Maybe the video aspect is irrelevant to the name.
What matters is: **private sharing with chosen people.**

From that lens:
- Nook (tucked away, intimate) — fits
- Den (pack gathering) — fits
- Bower (private showing space) — fits

---

## The Final Walk

Let me do one more walk through the grove.

```
    I have videos from the weekend.

    I don't want the Meadow (too public).
    I don't want Amber (that's storage, not sharing).

    I want to gather with my 4 friends and show them.

    Where do I go?

    Option A: We tuck into a NOOK—
              a small corner where we huddle and I show you my phone.
              Cozy. Quiet. Us.

    Option B: We gather in the DEN—
              the pack's living room. Family movie night.
              Warm. Together. Home.

    Option C: I invite you into my BOWER—
              my decorated private space, curated just for you.
              I'm showing you something beautiful.

    Option D: We find a HOLLOW in the tree—
              a secret chamber in the trunk.
              Hidden. Protected. Ours.
```

---

## My Gut Feeling

**Den** feels most natural for video sharing because it's about GATHERING to watch something. Family movie night energy. Pack comes together.

**Bower** is most unique and captures the VISUAL DISPLAY aspect perfectly.

**Nook** is simplest and the coziness is real, but feels slightly solitary.

**Hollow** is very Grove-fitting (tree hollow!) but doesn't add the gathering or visual element.

---

    │   world outside. Where you bring what   │
    │   matters to share with those who       │
    │   matter.                               │
    │                                         │
    │   Den is private video sharing for      │
    │   your closest circle. Not a channel,   │
    │   not a feed—just a cozy space where    │
    │   your friends gather to watch what     │
    │   you want to show them. Unknown        │
    │   faces blurred, everything processed   │
    │   locally, shared only with your pack.  │
    │                                         │
    │   *Gather with your pack.*              │

That feels... right?

## But Let Me Also Try BOWER

    │   A bower is a shelter of woven         │
    │   branches—a private space decorated    │
    │   with care. Bower birds are famous     │
    │   for curating their spaces, displaying │
    │   beautiful objects for those they      │
    │   invite inside.                        │

    │   Bower is private video sharing for    │
    │   your closest circle. Build your       │
    │   collection, invite who matters, show  │
    │   them what you've gathered. Unknown    │
    │   faces blurred, everything processed   │
    │   locally, shared only with those       │
    │   you choose.                           │

That's beautiful too. But more obscure.

## Okay. Decision Time.

The question was: Does Nook work? Or is there something better?

**My conclusion:**

Nook *works*. It's cozy, private, fits the Grove. But it undersells the GATHERING and VISUAL aspects of video sharing. It feels like curling up alone, not showing friends a video.

**Den** feels more natural for "gathering with your pack to watch videos."
It has the family movie night energy that matches the use case.

**Bower** is the most unique and poetic, capturing the visual display aspect.
But it requires more explanation.

If I had to choose:
1. **Den** for clarity and gathering energy
2. **Bower** for uniqueness and the visual/display connection
3. **Nook** if simplicity and existing momentum matter

---

## Final Thought: Maybe the Question Is...

Is this MORE about:

**A) The SPACE where you share** (Nook, Den, Hollow)
or
**B) The ACT of showing** (Bower, screening, projecting)

If it's about the space: **Den** wins (warm pack gathering).
If it's about the showing: **Bower** wins (curated visual display).

For a video sharing platform, the ACT of showing matters.
I lean **Bower**.

But **Den** is the safer choice. More intuitive.

## The Recommendation

After this journey, I think there are two strong paths:

### Path 1: Keep Nook
If you want simplicity and the current name is "good enough," Nook works.
Refine the tagline to emphasize gathering:
> *"Gather close. Share quietly."*

### Path 2: Rename to Den
If you want to emphasize the gathering/pack energy of watching videos together:
> *"Gather with your pack."*

### Path 3: Rename to Bower
If you want to emphasize the curated, visual display aspect:
> *"Build your bower. Invite who matters."*

## Where I Personally Land

**Den**.

Because when I imagine sharing a video with 4 friends, I don't imagine:
- Curling into a reading nook (solitary)
- Building a decorated bower (too much work)

I imagine:
- Gathering on the couch
- "Come here, watch this"
- Pack energy
- The den—the room where the family gathers

*den.grove.place*

*Gather with your pack.*

*End of journey. The path led to Den, but Nook is a reasonable resting point if the journey feels too far.*
