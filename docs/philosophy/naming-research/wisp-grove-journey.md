# A Journey Through the Grove

*Scratchpad for finding the right name for the ethical AI writing assistant*

## The Scene

                        What guides them forward?
```

## What IS This Thing?

Before I name it, I need to understand it.

An ethical AI writing assistant that:
- Polishes. Never replaces.
- Grammar checks. Tone analysis. Readability scores.
- **Never** generation.
- **Never** expansion.
- **Never** brainstorming.
- All features OFF by default.
- Zero data retention.
- Analyzes but doesn't store. Helps but doesn't write.

And then there's **Fireside** mode:
- For people who freeze at blank pages
- Some can't write but CAN talk
- A conversation that becomes a draft
- You speak, it organizes
- Still YOUR words, just... shaped

The critical distinction: **helper, not writer.**

---

## Walking Through...

I enter the grove. My tree is here. My blog. My voice.

I want to write something but the words aren't coming clean.
Something's off. The grammar tangles. The tone wavers.
I know what I want to say but it comes out muddy.

I don't need someone to WRITE for me.
I need... what?

A polish?
A second set of eyes?
A gentle "hey, this sentence is confusing"?

Something that sees what I've written and makes it clearer,
without changing what I said.

---

## The Wisp Metaphor

A will-o'-the-wisp is:
- An ephemeral light in forests and marshes
- Appears, guides, disappears
- Folklore: leads travelers (sometimes astray, sometimes to safety)
- Natural phenomenon, not artificial
- Subtle. You follow if you choose.

```
    The marsh at night:

                    *
                      *  *
                    *        a wisp appears
                   ( )
                  ( * )      "this way..."
                   ( )
                    *
                        *
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       You're lost in your own words.
       The wisp shows a path.
       You follow or you don't.
```

This captures:
- Appears when you need it, gone when you don't
- Guides but doesn't force
- Subtle, not commanding
- You're still making the choices

Does it capture **polishing**?

Hmm. A wisp is about direction, about "this way."
Is that the same as "this sentence is unclear"?

A wisp doesn't IMPROVE something.
A wisp LEADS somewhere.

---

## Let Me Sit With This

What does the assistant actually DO?

1. **Grammar check** - "this word is wrong"
2. **Tone analysis** - "this sounds harsher than you might want"
3. **Readability scores** - "this is dense"
4. **Fireside** - "talk to me, I'll help shape it into writing"

The first three are about REFINEMENT.
Like... polishing a stone? Sanding wood?
Making something that exists MORE ITSELF.

The fourth is about DRAWING OUT.
Like... a conversation by the fire that turns into stories.

---

## What in Nature Refines?

- Water smooths stones over time
- Wind shapes dunes and trees
- Moss softens edges
- Dew appears, glistens, evaporates
- Mist obscures then reveals

What if the metaphor isn't about GUIDING but about SOFTENING?

---

## Other Candidates

**Dew**
- Appears naturally, gently, in the right conditions
- Glistens on what's already there
- Makes things clearer/fresher
- Evaporates - no data retention
- "Dew on your words" - subtle freshness

But dew is passive. It doesn't analyze.

**Mist**
- Surrounds, softens
- Can obscure or reveal depending on thickness
- Creates atmosphere

But mist sounds like it HIDES things. Not right.

**Polish** (as a verb)
- Too literal
- Not a nature thing
- Grove names aren't verbs

**Gloss**
- Also too literal

---

## Back to Wisp

Let me reconsider.

A wisp is folklore. A mysterious light.
In stories, it can guide OR mislead.

The Grove is reclaiming the good version:
A wisp that gently shows the way,
that appears when you need it,
that helps you find your path through the marsh of words.

The "marsh of words" is actually poetic:
- When you're writing and everything's muddy
- When you can't find clarity
- When you're stuck in the bog of your own thoughts

The wisp doesn't PULL you out.
It shows you the way.
It says "this direction" and you choose to follow.

That's what good writing assistance should be.

---

## But What About Fireside?

Here's where it gets interesting.

Wisp is the subtle light in the marsh.
Fireside is the warm hearth where conversation flows.

```
    Two modes of the same thing:

    ┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                   WISP                      │
    │         (the umbrella service)              │
    │                                             │
    │   ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐   │
    │   │   Polish    │    │    Fireside     │   │
    │   │   Mode      │    │    Mode         │   │
    │   │             │    │                 │   │
    │   │  (editing)  │    │  (conversation  │   │
    │   │  (grammar)  │    │   becomes       │   │
    │   │  (tone)     │    │   draft)        │   │
    │   └─────────────┘    └─────────────────┘   │
    │                                             │
    └────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Does "Wisp" as the parent make sense?

Actually... maybe?

- The wisp is the guiding light
- Sometimes it guides you through the fog (Polish mode)
- Sometimes it leads you to a warm fire (Fireside mode)

*The wisp leads you to the fireside.*

That's kind of beautiful.

---

## Testing the Tagline

> "Wisp is where you _____________."

- "Wisp is where you refine your voice."
- "Wisp is where your words become clearer."
- "Wisp is where you find your way through the fog."

Or:

> "Wisp is the _____________."

- "Wisp is the gentle light that shows you clarity."
- "Wisp is the guide through murky drafts."

Hmm. These work but don't SING.

---

## What If We Focus on What It ISN'T?

AI writing tools are scary right now because they REPLACE.
They generate. They expand. They become the voice.

Wisp is the anti-thesis:
- Sees but doesn't speak for you
- Helps but doesn't write
- Appears but doesn't remain

Zero data retention is crucial:
- Your words analyzed, never stored
- The wisp sees, helps, forgets
- It was there. Now it's not. Only your clearer words remain.

*A helper, not a writer.*

---

## The Ephemeral Quality

```
    What Wisp does:

    [Your draft] -----> [Wisp appears] -----> [Clarity]
                             |
                             |
                             v
                        [Wisp fades]
                    (nothing retained)

    What remains: Your words, refined. Your voice, clearer.
    What doesn't: Any trace of the wisp itself.
```

This is VERY wisp-like.
A will-o'-the-wisp appears, does its thing, vanishes.
You might question if it was there at all.

The privacy model (zero retention) actually deepens the metaphor:
- Ephemeral by nature
- Leaves no footprint
- Only the effect remains

---

## Does Wisp Capture "Polishing"?

Strictly speaking, no. A wisp doesn't polish.

But I think the metaphor stretches:
- The wisp illuminates the path to clearer writing
- It doesn't DO the polishing, it SHOWS you what needs polish
- "The wisp highlighted this confusing sentence"
- You do the actual revision

That's right. Wisp should HIGHLIGHT, not FIX.
Show you the rough spots. Let you smooth them yourself.

*The wisp doesn't sand the wood. It casts light on the splinters.*

---

## Re-examining Fireside

Fireside as a mode name:

```
                    The Cold Night
                    (blank page paralysis)
                              |
                              v
                         .  *  .
                      *    wisp    *   "follow me"
                        *      *
                              |
                              v
                        ___________
                       (  fireside  )
                       (   warmth   )
                       (conversation)
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~
                           🔥

    "Sit. Talk. The fire listens. Your words take shape."
```

Fireside works because:
- It's warm (reduces anxiety)
- It's conversational (talk, don't type)
- Stories emerge naturally by firesides
- It's shelter from the cold (blank page fear)

The wisp leads you there. The fire does the rest.

---

## Other Names I Considered and Rejected

**Ember** - Too close to Amber (storage). Also ember implies something dying down.

**Glow** - Generic. No forest specificity.

**Moth** - Moths are drawn to flame, but we don't want users to be moths. Wrong relationship.

**Firefly** - Actually interesting? Small lights that appear at dusk. But fireflies are more playful/nostalgic than helpful/guiding.

**Lantern** - A lantern is a tool you carry. But this thing isn't something you carry - it comes to you. Also Lantern is everywhere in software.

**Beacon** - Too directional, too attention-seeking. Not subtle.

**Shimmer** - Not a thing, just an effect.

**Glimmer** - Same problem.

---

## What Does Wisp Sound Like?

Say it aloud: "Wisp"

- Soft
- Short
- The "w" is gentle
- The "sp" is like a whisper ending
- It almost sounds like what it is

"I used Wisp to check my draft."
"Wisp suggested this sentence was unclear."
"I opened Fireside in Wisp and talked through my ideas."

It works. It's not clunky. It's not pretentious.

---

## Checking Conflicts

Looking at existing Grove names:
- No "W" names currently
- "Wisp" doesn't overlap with any existing concepts
- It's distinct from Waystone (help center - waystones are physical markers you find)

Wisp is ethereal.
Waystone is solid.
Different vibes, different purposes.

---

## The Privacy Angle

This is important. AI writing tools often:
- Store your data
- Train on your writing
- Build profiles
- Retain everything

Wisp's zero-retention model is the antidote.

What in nature appears, helps, and leaves no trace?

- Morning mist (burns off)
- Dew (evaporates)
- **A wisp (fades into nothing)**

The will-o'-the-wisp is PERFECT for this.
It's literally defined by appearing and disappearing.
No evidence it was there except the direction you're now walking.

---

## The Verdict

I've walked through this grove, and I keep coming back to the same place.

**Wisp works.**

    │   conversation that becomes a post. Wisp asks          │

    │   the story. It just creates the space where stories   │

## Why Wisp Works

1. **Ephemeral** - Matches zero data retention perfectly
2. **Guiding** - Shows the way without forcing
3. **Subtle** - Appears when needed, fades when not
4. **Natural** - Part of forest folklore, fits the Grove
5. **Not a tool** - It's a phenomenon, which feels right for AI assistance
6. **Pairs with Fireside** - The wisp leads you to warmth

## The Final Picture

```
    THE WRITING JOURNEY IN GROVE:

         You sit down to write

        YOUR VOICE, CLEARER
        (wisp fades, words remain)
```

---

## One More Thing

I almost forgot to mention: the internal name is `GroveWisp`.

That's fine. Internal names are `Grove[Thing]`.
Public name is just `Wisp`.

When someone asks "what helps me write better in Grove?"
The answer is: "Wisp."

*A light that appears, helps, and fades away.*
*Only your words remain.*

---

## Taglines (Final Options)

- *"A helper, not a writer."*
- *"The light that guides you through murky drafts."*
- *"Appears when you need it. Fades when you don't."*
- *"Your words, illuminated."*

The current one works best:
> *A helper, not a writer—and sometimes, a good listener.*

This captures both modes:
- Helper, not writer = core philosophy
- Good listener = Fireside mode

---

## Conclusion

**Keep the name Wisp.**

The metaphor is sound:
- Will-o'-the-wisp = ephemeral guiding light
- Appears in forest/marsh = fits Grove ecosystem
- Guides without forcing = ethical AI philosophy
- Vanishes without trace = zero data retention

Fireside as a mode works beautifully:
- The wisp leads you to the fire
- Two different kinds of help, one name

The name is:
- Soft to say
- Distinct from other Grove names
- Not used elsewhere notably
- Evocative without being precious

*The wisp was always the right name. We just needed to walk through the grove to be sure.*
