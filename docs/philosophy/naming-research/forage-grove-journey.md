# A Journey Through the Grove

*Scratchpad for examining whether "Forage" is the right name for domain discovery*

## Walking Through...

I enter the grove with a project in my head.
I don't have a name yet. I don't have a *place* yet.

Before I can plant, I need to find where.
Before I can grow, I need to claim my ground.

I walk the forest floor, **looking for something specific**.
Not just any mushroom. Not just any berry.
The *right* one. The one that fits.

I pass the **Meadow** where others already have names.
I see the **Lattice** that will support what I build.
I dream of my **Foliage**, my **Heartwood**, my **Rings**.

But first... I need a domain.

---

## What IS Domain Searching?

Let me think about what this tool actually does:

```
    You arrive with:
    ┌────────────────────────────┐
    │  "I'm building a tea shop  │
    │   online, cozy vibes,      │
    │   budget under $50"        │
    └─────────────┬──────────────┘
                  │
                  ▼
         ┌───────────────┐
         │   🤖 AI       │
         │   analyzes    │
         │   searches    │
         │   filters     │
         │   curates     │
         └───────┬───────┘
                 │
                 ▼
    ┌────────────────────────────┐
    │  warmcup.co     ✓ $12     │
    │  steepwell.com  ✓ $35     │
    │  tealeaf.io     ✓ $29     │
    │  brewquiet.com  ✓ $15     │
    └────────────────────────────┘

    You leave with: a name. A place. Yours.
```

---

## Breaking Down the Action

What's happening here?

1. **Input**: vague feeling, project vision, constraints
2. **Process**: AI-powered intelligent search
3. **Output**: curated list of available, fitting domains
4. **Result**: you claim one (ownership)

This is:
- **Searching** (looking for something specific)
- **Intelligent** (AI does the work)
- **Selective** (not everything, just what fits)
- **Naming** (finding the RIGHT name)
- **Claiming** (you take it home, it's yours)

---

## Is "Forage" Right?

The current description from grove-naming.md:

> "Before you can plant, you have to search. You walk the forest floor,
> looking for what you need: something that fits, something that's *available*,
> something worth bringing home."

This captures:
- ✓ Searching
- ✓ Walking the forest floor
- ✓ Finding what's available
- ✓ Bringing home

But let me sit with what foraging actually IS...

```
    FORAGING:
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                     │
    │   You walk through the woods.       │
    │   Eyes on the ground.               │
    │   You know mushrooms, berries.      │
    │   You recognize what's good.        │
    │   You gather. You bring home.       │
    │                                     │
    │   It's MANUAL.                      │
    │   It requires YOUR knowledge.       │
    │   You do the searching.             │
    │                                     │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

But domain searching with AI is:

```
    AI DOMAIN DISCOVERY:
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                     │
    │   You describe what you want.       │
    │   Something else does the work.     │
    │   It brings back options.           │
    │   You choose from what it found.    │
    │                                     │
    │   It's ASSISTED.                    │
    │   Something else has the skill.     │
    │   You wait. You receive. You pick.  │
    │                                     │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## The Gap

Foraging implies *you* are the one with knowledge.
*You* walk. *You* search. *You* recognize.

But this tool... YOU don't have that knowledge.
The AI does.
You describe. It hunts. It returns.

This is more like...

```
         🐕 TRUFFLE HUNTING

    You can't smell truffles.
    But the pig can. The dog can.
    You tell them what you're looking for.
    They sniff. They dig. They find.
    You bring home what they unearthed.
```

Or like...

```
         🦅 FALCONRY

    You can't catch the rabbit.
    But the falcon can.
    You release it. It hunts. It returns.
    You receive what it caught.
```

Or like...

```
         🔮 DOWSING

    You can't sense the water underground.
    But the rod bends. It knows.
    You follow. It leads. You find.
```

---

## What in Nature is "Assisted Discovery"?

Things that help you find what you couldn't alone:

| Helper | What it finds | How |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| Truffle pig | Rare mushrooms | Scent |
| Hunting dog | Game birds | Scent + pointing |
| Falcon | Prey | Speed + sight |
| Divining rod | Water | Mysterious sense |
| Scout | Safe paths | Going ahead |
| Tracker | Game | Reading signs |

The key insight: **You don't do the finding. Something else does.**

Foraging is YOU doing the work.
This is... something else working FOR you.

---

## Wait. Let Me Reread the Current Description.

> "Forage is an AI-powered domain hunting tool that turns weeks of
> frustrating searches into hours. Tell it about your project, your vibe,
> your budget, and it returns a curated list of available domains that
> actually fit. Finding the right name takes effort. Forage does the
> searching so you can focus on choosing."

Hmm. "Forage does the searching so you can focus on choosing."

So the tool IS the forager. You're not foraging. IT forages for you.

That's... a little awkward, isn't it?

You don't go to "Forage" and forage.
You go to "Forage" and it forages for you.

---

## Let Me Visualize Both Interpretations

```
    INTERPRETATION 1: "Forage" = the act you perform

    You ──────▶ Forage (verb) ──────▶ Find domains

    Problem: You're not actually foraging. The AI is.


    INTERPRETATION 2: "Forage" = the tool that forages for you

    You ──────▶ [Forage] ──────▶ AI forages ──────▶ You receive

    This works, but it's naming the tool after what IT does,
    not what YOU experience.
```

Compare to other Grove names:

| Name | What YOU do |
|------|-------------|
| Meadow | You gather with others |
| Pantry | You take what you need |
| Porch | You sit and talk |
| Amber | You store things |
| Trove | You discover treasures |

"Forage" fits if the name is "what the tool does."
But most Grove names are "what you experience."

---

## Hmm. Let Me Walk the Grove Again.

I have a project. I need a domain.

Where do I go?

```
                         🏠
                    Your future blog
                    (needs a name first)
                          |
                          |  "What's my address?"
                          |
                          ▼
                    ┌───────────┐
                    │  ???      │
                    │           │
                    │ You ask   │
                    │ It finds  │
                    │ You claim │
                    └───────────┘
```

What is this place? This experience?

- Is it a place you go? (like Meadow, Pantry, Nook)
- Is it a process? (like Bloom, Patina)
- Is it a helper? (like Wisp)

---

## The Nature of the Interaction

When you need a domain name, you're:

1. **Seeking** - you want something specific
2. **Asking** - you describe what you need
3. **Receiving** - something is brought to you
4. **Claiming** - you take ownership

It's like... asking a scout to go ahead.
Or sending a dog into the brush.
Or consulting someone who knows the territory.

---

## New Directions to Consider

### Scout

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  SCOUT                              │
    │                                     │
    │  A scout goes ahead.                │
    │  Surveys the territory.             │
    │  Reports back what's available.     │
    │  "Clear path here. Danger there."   │
    │                                     │
    │  scout.grove.place                  │
    │  "Send the Scout ahead"             │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Pro: Captures the "intelligent agent finding things for you"
Con: Scout is more about paths/dangers than finding *things*

### Dowse

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  DOWSE                              │
    │                                     │
    │  Dowsing finds what's hidden.       │
    │  Water beneath the surface.         │
    │  A mysterious ability to locate.    │
    │                                     │
    │  dowse.grove.place                  │
    │  "Let Dowse find your domain"       │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Pro: Captures "finding hidden/specific things"
Con: Dowsing has pseudoscience connotations. Also obscure word.

### Sniff / Scent

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  SNIFF                              │
    │                                     │
    │  Like a truffle dog.                │
    │  You can't smell it.                │
    │  But Sniff can.                     │
    │                                     │
    │  sniff.grove.place                  │
    │  "Sniff out the perfect domain"     │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Pro: Perfect metaphor for AI-assisted finding
Con: "Sniff" sounds a bit... undignified? Surveillance-y?

### Seek

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  SEEK                               │
    │                                     │
    │  To search for something specific.  │
    │  With intention.                    │
    │                                     │
    │  seek.grove.place                   │
    │  "Seek your domain"                 │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Pro: Clear, simple, implies purpose
Con: Generic. Not very "grove-y"

### Unearth

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  UNEARTH                            │
    │                                     │
    │  To dig up something hidden.        │
    │  Buried treasure. Fossils.          │
    │  Things that were waiting.          │
    │                                     │
    │  unearth.grove.place                │
    │  "Unearth your perfect domain"      │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Pro: Strong action, implies discovery, forest-floor vibe
Con: Long word. Also implies digging (effortful)

---

## What About Animals That Find Things?

In the grove, we don't have many animal names yet...

| Animal | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| Truffle pig | Sniffs out rare mushrooms |
| Bloodhound | Tracks specific scents |
| Falcon | Hunts from above, sharp sight |
| Owl | Sees in darkness, wisdom |
| Bee | Finds flowers, returns with nectar |

**Wait. Bees.**

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  BEES                               │
    │                                     │
    │  A bee goes out into the world.     │
    │  It searches for flowers.           │
    │  It comes back with nectar.         │
    │  And it TELLS others where to go.   │
    │                                     │
    │  The bee FINDS. The bee RETURNS.    │
    │  The bee COMMUNICATES.              │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

But "bee" is singular and weird as a service name.

What about the hive behavior?

---

## Actually, Let Me Return to Forage

Rereading everything, I'm wondering if I'm overthinking this.

"Forage" works because:

1. It's a real forest activity
2. It's about finding things on the forest floor
3. The description explicitly says "Forage does the searching"
4. Users understand "foraging" = looking for stuff

The mild awkwardness of "the tool forages for you" is actually kind of charming?

"Wisp" is similar - Wisp is the helper, not you. "The Wisp guides you."
"Forage" works the same way - "Forage finds for you."

---

## But Let Me Explore One More Direction

What if the name is about what you RECEIVE, not what happens?

**Trove** is named this way - it's about the collection of treasures you find.

What do you receive from domain discovery?

- Options
- Names
- Possibilities
- Seeds (of future projects)

### Seedling?

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  SEEDLING                           │
    │                                     │
    │  Before a tree, there's a seed.     │
    │  Before a project, there's a name.  │
    │  The first tiny beginning.          │
    │                                     │
    │  seedling.grove.place               │
    │  "Find your seedling"               │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Hmm, but "Plant" is already onboarding. Seedling conflicts conceptually.

### Sprout?

Similar problem. Also, Sprout is more about growth than finding.

---

## The Naming Focus

Here's what I keep coming back to:

Domain discovery is about **finding a name**.

Not finding food (forage).
Not finding paths (scout).
Not finding water (dowse).

Finding... what your project is CALLED.

What in nature is about names?

```
    Naming in nature:

    - Species get Latin names (taxonomy)
    - Places get named after features
    - Animals name their territory
    - Birds have calls that identify them

    What identifies something in a forest?

    - Its species (oak, maple, pine)
    - Its call (bird songs)
    - Its scent (animal marking)
    - Its place (the big rock, the bent tree)
```

---

## What About "Call"?

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  CALL                               │
    │                                     │
    │  Every bird has a call.             │
    │  Unique. Recognizable.              │
    │  The way others find it.            │
    │  The way it's known.                │
    │                                     │
    │  "What's your call?"                │
    │  = "What's your domain?"            │
    │                                     │
    │  call.grove.place                   │
    │  "Find your call"                   │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Pro: Beautiful metaphor. "Your call" = your unique identifier
Con: "Call" is very overloaded (phone call, function call)

---

## Testing the Taglines

A good Grove name completes: "[Name] is where you ___" or "[Name] is the ___"

**Forage**: "Forage is where you find your domain."
✓ Works.

**Scout**: "Scout is where you... send a scout?"
✗ Awkward.

**Dowse**: "Dowse is where you find what's hidden."
✓ Works but obscure.

**Unearth**: "Unearth is where you discover your domain."
✓ Works.

**Call**: "Call is where you find your call."
✗ Confusing.

---

## The Deeper Question

I've been circling around something.

"Forage" captures the activity: searching, finding, bringing home.

But does it capture the *magic*?

The magic of this tool is:
- You describe a vibe
- AI understands
- Perfect options appear

That's not foraging. That's... having a guide who knows the forest better than you.

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  THE GUIDE METAPHOR                 │
    │                                     │
    │  There's someone who knows          │
    │  every corner of this forest.       │
    │  Every hidden clearing.             │
    │  Every unclaimed spot.              │
    │                                     │
    │  You describe what you want.        │
    │  They say: "I know just the place." │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

But "Guide" is too generic.

What IS a forest guide called?

- Ranger (too authoritative)
- Pathfinder (about paths, not places)
- Woodsman (gendered)
- Tracker (about following, not finding new)

---

## What If Forage IS Right, But For Different Reasons?

Let me reframe:

Forage isn't about YOU foraging.
Forage is THE FORAGER.

Just like:
- A smith is at the Forge
- A lookout is at the Scout post
- A forager works at... Forage?

No wait, that's circular.

Let me try again:

"Forage" as a NOUN could mean:
- The things you forage (like "the forage" = wild food)
- The place where foraging happens
- The result of foraging

"Here's your forage" = "Here's what we foraged for you"

That... actually works?

```

## Coming to a Conclusion

After walking through this grove, here's what I see:

**"Forage" works** because:

1. It's deeply forest-themed
2. "Forest floor searching" is the right vibe
3. As a noun, it means "what was gathered for you"
4. The description clarifies: "Forage does the searching so you can focus on choosing"
5. It's already live, already fits, already has momentum

**The slight awkwardness** of "something forages for you" is:
- Present but minor
- Shared by other names (Wisp helps, Bloom works)
- Clarified by the tagline

**What Forage captures well:**
- ✓ Searching (yes)
- ✓ Forest-based (yes, forest floor)
- ✓ Finding (yes)
- ✓ Bringing home (yes)

**What Forage captures less well:**
- ~ AI-powered (not explicit, but that's okay)
- ~ Naming focus (implied by "finding what fits")

## Final Description (Affirmed)

## Forage
**Domain Discovery** - `forage.grove.place`

Before you can plant, you have to search. You walk the forest floor, looking for what you need: something that fits, something that's *available*, something worth bringing home.

Forage is an AI-powered domain hunting tool that turns weeks of frustrating searches into hours. Tell it about your project, your vibe, your budget, and it returns a curated list of available domains that actually fit. Finding the right name takes effort. Forage does the searching so you can focus on choosing.

*The first step of every project: finding where to put it.*

The name was there. It was already planted. It just needed examining to confirm it belongs.

*Sometimes the journey is about confirming you're already home.*
