# A Journey Through the Grove: Storage

*Scratchpad for questioning whether Amber is the right name*

                 Where do you PUT your things?
```

## The Current Name: Amber

Amber is fossilized tree resin. It captures things and holds them forever.

```
        ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
        │                                 │
        │      🦟 ← ancient bug           │
        │           frozen in time        │
        │                                 │
        │      AMBER                      │
        │      (50 million years)         │
        │                                 │
        └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What amber does:**
- Captures a moment
- Preserves perfectly
- Suspends time
- Cannot be changed
- Protects from decay

**The poetry:** "Every file you upload is preserved in Amber,
organized and accessible from one place."

---

## But wait. Is that what storage IS?

When I think about my files...

```
    TODAY                        TOMORROW
    ┌──────────┐                 ┌──────────┐
    │ photo.jpg│  ← I might      │          │
    │ doc.pdf  │    delete this  │ doc.pdf  │
    │ old.zip  │  ← definitely   │ new.png  │ ← added this
    │          │    deleting     │          │
    └──────────┘                 └──────────┘
```

Files aren't frozen in time. They're **living**.
I add things. Delete things. Reorganize.
I check what's using space. I clean up.

Amber suggests stasis. Storage is motion.

---

## What IS storage in the grove?

Let me think about what you actually DO with storage:

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  THINGS I DO WITH MY FILES                  │
    ├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
    │  • Upload (bring things in)                 │
    │  • Download (take things out)               │
    │  • Delete (remove what I don't need)        │
    │  • Organize (move things around)            │
    │  • Check usage (see what's there)           │
    │  • Buy more space (expand)                  │
    │  • Export (take everything with me)         │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This is ACTIVE. This is curated. This is tended.

---

## What in a forest holds your things?

**Places where things are stored:**

```
    HOLLOW              CACHE               DEN
    ┌─────┐           ┌─────┐           ┌─────┐
    │ 🌲  │           │ 🐿️   │           │ 🦊  │
    │ ◯   │ ← tree    │ 🌰🌰 │ ← hidden  │     │ ← lived-in
    │ ▼   │   cavity  │ 🌰   │   stash   │~~~~~│   shelter
    └─────┘           └─────┘           └─────┘
```

**Hollow** - A cavity in a tree trunk. Where owls nest.
Where things are tucked away. Private, protected, part of your tree.

**Cache** - A squirrel's hidden stash. Things gathered and stored
for later. Active curation. You add, you take, you remember where things are.

**Den** - A fox's home. Not just storage, but a lived-in space.
Everything has its place. You return to it.

---

## The Preservation Question

Amber preserves. But Patina already exists for backups—
the protective layer that forms over time.

```
    AMBER (current)              PATINA (backups)
    ┌────────────────┐           ┌────────────────┐
    │ Active storage │           │ Nightly backups│
    │ Your files     │  ───→     │ Weekly archives│
    │ You manage     │  copies   │ 12 weeks deep  │
    └────────────────┘           └────────────────┘
```

If Patina is "age as armor, time as protection"—
isn't that the preservation metaphor?

What's left for the active storage layer to BE?

---

## Let me walk through the forest...

I enter the grove. I'm carrying things.

```
                    🎒  ← backpack full of files
                    /\
                   /  \
                    ME

    blog images, email attachments, profile pictures
```

I need somewhere to put them.

I don't want to freeze them in amber forever.
I want a place that's MINE.

Where in a forest do I put my belongings?

---

## What about SAP?

Sap is the LIVING version of amber.
It's flowing. It's the tree's lifeblood.

```
    SAP (living)    →    AMBER (fossilized)
    ┌──────────┐         ┌──────────┐
    │  flows   │  time   │  frozen  │
    │  moves   │  ───→   │  static  │
    │  nourishes│        │  preserved│
    └──────────┘         └──────────┘
```

**Sap** feeds the tree. It moves nutrients.
It's active, vital, essential.

But "sap" sounds weird? "Check your Sap"?
"How much Sap are you using?"

Hmm. The word doesn't feel right even if the metaphor does.

---

## Let me think about the FEELING

What does managing your digital belongings feel like?

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                                 │
    │  "These are MY things"                          │
    │  "I know where everything is"                   │
    │  "I can see what's taking up space"             │
    │  "I can make room when I need to"               │
    │  "Everything important is safe"                 │
    │                                                 │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

It's... custodianship. Stewardship.
Like maintaining a home, or tending a garden.

---

## Places in a forest where you KEEP things:

**Burrow** - underground, cozy, yours
**Hollow** - in the tree, protected, private
**Cache** - hidden stash, gathered treasures
**Den** - a home, organized, lived-in
**Nest** - where you build with gathered materials
**Lodge** - beaver's carefully constructed home

---

## Wait. What about HOLLOW?

A hollow in a tree is:
- Part of YOUR tree (your blog, your space)
- Where you keep things tucked away
- Private, protected
- Natural, organic
- Accessible when you need it

```
                   🌲
                  /|\
                 / | \
                /  |  \
               /___|___\
              |         |
              |   ◯◯◯   | ← your files, nested in the hollow
              |  ◯◯◯◯◯  |
              |   ◯◯◯   |
              |_________|
                  ║
                  ║
            ══════╬══════
```

"Check your Hollow"
"Your Hollow is 80% full"
"Browse what's in your Hollow"

Hollow is...
- Part of your tree (connected to your blog identity)
- Active storage (things go in and out)
- Protected (inside the tree)
- Natural (trees have hollows)

But "hollow" also means empty. That's the problem.
"Your Hollow is empty" sounds sad.
"Hollow promises" - negative connotation.

---

## What about CACHE?

A squirrel's cache is:
- Actively curated (they add and retrieve constantly)
- Scattered but remembered (they know where things are)
- Seasonal (they prepare, they use, they replenish)
- Purposeful (everything stored for a reason)

```
        🐿️  "I know exactly where my acorns are"

    ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  🌰 photo.jpg     💎 attachment.pdf    │
    │  🌰 banner.png    💎 backup.zip        │
    │  🌰 avatar.jpg    💎 export.json       │
    └────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

"Check your Cache"
"Clear some space in your Cache"
"Your Cache is growing"

But... "cache" is already a tech term.
Browser cache, CPU cache.
It might confuse people.

And caches are HIDDEN. Storage should be visible.

---

## Let me reconsider AMBER

Maybe I'm overthinking the "static" problem.

What amber ACTUALLY does:
- Captures what matters
- Keeps it safe
- You can see inside (amber is translucent)
- Preserves against decay
- Holds precious moments

```
        ┌─────────────────────────────┐
        │      ╭─────────────╮        │
        │      │  📷 photo   │        │
        │      │  from last  │        │
        │      │  summer     │        │
        │      ╰─────────────╯        │
        │                             │
        │   AMBER: "I've got this"    │
        │                             │
        └─────────────────────────────┘
```

The metaphor isn't that files CAN'T change.
It's that they're SAFE. Protected. Held.

"Amber isn't trying to be Dropbox or Google Drive.
It's the storage layer that already exists in Grove,
made visible and manageable."

---

## The difference between AMBER and PATINA

```
    AMBER (active storage)          PATINA (backup)
    ┌────────────────────┐          ┌────────────────────┐
    │                    │          │                    │
    │  You interact      │          │  Happens silently  │
    │  with this daily   │          │  in background     │
    │                    │          │                    │
    │  Upload/download   │          │  Nightly snapshots │
    │  Delete/organize   │          │  Weekly archives   │
    │  Check usage       │          │  You never see it  │
    │                    │          │                    │
    │  VISIBLE resin     │          │  INVISIBLE layer   │
    │  You can see       │          │  Quiet protection  │
    │  what's inside     │          │                    │
    └────────────────────┘          └────────────────────┘
```

Amber is the resin you can hold, see through,
examine what's captured inside.

Patina is the layer that forms without you noticing—
protection through age and time.

---

## What does Amber evoke?

- Warmth (golden color)
- Transparency (you see what's inside)
- Preciousness (amber is valued)
- Natural preservation
- Light catching through resin

```

              ▼

```

---

## Testing alternative names

Let me try the tagline test:

**"Amber is where you keep what matters."**
^ That works. Storage of precious things.

**"Hollow is where you tuck things away."**
^ Hmm, feels hidden, secretive.

**"Cache is where you stash your files."**
^ Too techy, too temporary.

**"Den is where your files live."**
^ Cozy but maybe too casual?

**"Trove is where you find treasures."**
^ Already taken for library books!

---

## The case FOR Amber

1. **It's already established** - domain claimed, repository named
2. **Warmth** - amber is golden, warm, inviting
3. **Visibility** - you can see what's inside amber
4. **Value** - amber is precious, your files matter
5. **Natural fit** - amber comes from trees (sap → amber)
6. **Pairs with Patina** - visible active storage vs invisible backup

The "static" concern might be overthought.
Amber isn't about files being frozen—
it's about files being HELD. Kept. Safe.

---

## The case AGAINST Amber

1. **Stasis** - amber does imply "frozen in time"
2. **Fossilization** - suggests something old, unchanging
3. **Passive** - you don't interact with amber, you just look at it
4. **Not active enough** - storage is constantly changing

---

## But wait—one more thought

What if the metaphor is about HOW you see your files?

```
    RAW SAP                    AMBER
    (the upload)               (how you view them)

    📎 ─────────────────────→  ✨ 📎 ✨
    messy, just                organized,
    uploaded                   precious,
                               visible
```

Amber isn't saying your files are FROZEN.
It's saying when you look at your storage in Grove,
you're looking at your collected treasures
held in warm golden light.

The act of putting something in Amber
is the act of deciding it matters enough to keep.

---

## Alternative: KEEP

What if we went simpler?

**Keep** - where you keep things
- "Check your Keep"
- "Your Keep is 80% full"
- "Add to your Keep"

Keep is:
- A castle keep (the safest place)
- "For keeps" (permanent, valued)
- The act of keeping (active, intentional)

```
        🏰 THE KEEP
        ┌─────────┐
        │ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │  ← fortified
        │ ▓     ▓ │     protected
        │ ▓ 📁  ▓ │     your files
        │ ▓     ▓ │     inside
        └─────────┘
```

But... "keep" might be too generic.
It's not nature-themed.
A castle isn't a forest.

---

## Coming back to center

The more I explore, the more I realize:

**Amber works because it's about PRECIOUSNESS, not STASIS.**

When you put something in Amber, you're saying:
"This matters to me. Keep it safe."

The fact that amber is warm, translucent, and comes from trees
makes it perfect for Grove.

```
    🌲 SAP flows from the tree
         ↓
    🔶 SAP becomes AMBER
         ↓
    ✨ AMBER holds what matters
         ↓
    🛡️ PATINA protects over time
```

It's part of the tree's lifecycle.
Sap is living. Amber is keeping.
Patina is the backup that forms silently.

---

## Final visualization

```

                       ║

                       ║
    PATINA ────────────║─────────────── silent backup layer
                 (time's protection)
```

---

## The Answer

**Amber is right.**

Not because files are frozen—but because they're HELD.

Amber captures what matters to you.
It's warm. It's visible. It's precious.
You can see what's inside.
You can add or remove things.
But what's there is KEPT.

The metaphor isn't about stasis.
It's about value. About care.
About saying "this is worth keeping."

And in the Grove, where Patina quietly protects
and Rings quietly record growth,
Amber is the visible layer—
the one you actively tend and curate.

*"Every file you upload is held in Amber,
organized and accessible, warm and safe."*

---

## Lingering alternatives (for the record)

If we WERE to rename, the strongest candidates:

1. **Hollow** - part of your tree, where you tuck things
   - Con: "hollow" sounds empty

2. **Keep** - where you keep precious things
   - Con: not nature-themed enough

3. **Cache** - actively curated storage
   - Con: too techy, implies hidden

But Amber remains the best fit.

*Conclusion: Amber holds.*
