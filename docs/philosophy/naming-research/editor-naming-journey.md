# Naming Journey: The Markdown Editor in Arbor

> Finding the right name for where Wanderers write their posts.

---

## What We're Naming

The Markdown editor within Arbor—the place where Wanderers compose their blog posts. Currently just called "the editor" or "Markdown editor." It's a core part of the writing experience and deserves a name that reflects its role.

**Existing ideas from the issue:** Quill, Inkwell

## Visualizing the Grove

The editor lives *inside* Arbor. It's not a separate service—it's a space within the admin panel where writing happens.

---

## What IS This Thing?

### Is it a place, object, or process?

It's a **place**—but an intimate one. A space within a space. Like:
- A study within a house
- A writing desk by a window
- A quiet corner where you sit and think

### What does it DO?

- It's where words come to life
- Where thoughts become posts
- The creative sanctuary within the admin panel
- Where Wanderers spend the most meaningful time

### What emotion should it evoke?

- **Warmth** — not clinical like "editor" or "composer"
- **Focus** — a place to concentrate
- **Creation** — where things are made
- **Intimacy** — personal, yours

### How should it fit in sentences?

> "Open [name] to write a new post"
> "I spent the morning in [name]"
> "[Name] is where I do my best thinking"

---

## Walking Through the Grove

I'm a Wanderer. I've taken root. I have my tree.

I wake up with something to say. A thought that's been growing. I want to write.

I go to my tree. I enter Arbor—the control center, the structured framework where I manage things. But I don't want to *manage* right now. I want to *write*.

Where do I go?

I look for... a quiet space. Not the dashboard with its settings and stats. Something softer. Somewhere I can sit with my thoughts.

I find...

*What do I find?*

---

## Evaluating the Existing Ideas

### Quill
- **The nature connection:** A feather used for writing. Bird → forest connection.
- **The vibe:** Classic, literary, elegant
- **The problem:** It's a *tool*, not a *place*. "I wrote in my quill" doesn't quite work. Also feels a bit... expected? It's the obvious "fancy word for writing."
- **Sentence test:** "Open Quill to write" ✓ but "I spent the morning in Quill" ✗

### Inkwell
- **The nature connection:** Where ink is kept. Less direct nature tie, more craft/study vibes.
- **The vibe:** Warm, old-fashioned, intimate
- **The problem:** Also an object, not a place. "Writing in my inkwell" is strange.
- **Sentence test:** "Open Inkwell to write" ✓ but "I spent the morning in Inkwell" ✗

Both feel like *implements* rather than *spaces*. The editor isn't a tool you pick up—it's a room you enter.

## Brainstorming: What's in a Forest That's for Writing/Creating?

**Places where you might write:**
- A hollow in a tree (private, enclosed)
- A clearing (open, light)
- A den (cozy, hidden)
- A perch (elevated view)
- A bower (sheltered, intimate)

**Objects/Processes:**
- Sap flowing → ideas flowing
- Bark → the outer layer, what you show the world
- Pith → the soft center, the core of meaning
- Grain → the texture of your words

**Things birds do:**
- Nest → building something
- Song → expression
- Roost → resting place

**Paper/Writing connections in nature:**
- Birch bark (used for writing in many cultures)
- Papyrus (reeds)
- Leaf (page)
- Scroll/unfurling

---

## Candidate Names

### 1. **Hollow**
- A hollow in a tree—a sheltered cavity, private and protected
- "I spent the morning in the Hollow"
- "Open the Hollow to write a new post"
- **Vibe:** Intimate, private, a space that's yours alone
- **Concern:** Might sound empty/negative? "hollow words"

### 2. **Bower**
- A sheltered place in a garden or woods, often made of branches/vines
- A private, shaded retreat
- "I wrote this in my Bower"
- "The Bower is where my thoughts take shape"
- **Vibe:** Sheltered, intimate, romantic, creative
- **Concern:** Some might not know the word? But that's true of many Grove names.

### 3. **Perch**
- Where a bird rests and surveys the world
- A place of perspective before you share your voice (song)
- "From my Perch, I write what I see"
- **Vibe:** Elevated, thoughtful, observational
- **Concern:** Feels more about looking out than creating

### 4. **Den**
- A cozy, private space
- Where animals retreat to rest and create (raise young)
- "I've been in the Den all morning"
- **Vibe:** Cozy, private, warm
- **Concern:** Might feel too... animalistic? Not quite forest-y enough?

### 5. **Roost**
- Where birds settle to rest
- A place that's home
- "I'm heading to the Roost to write"
- **Vibe:** Comfortable, familiar, returning home
- **Concern:** Roost implies rest/sleep more than creation

### 6. **Glade**
- A small clearing in the forest where light comes through
- A peaceful, beautiful space
- "I write in the Glade"
- **Vibe:** Peaceful, inspired, touched by light
- **Concern:** We already have Clearing (status page). Too similar?

### 7. **Nook**
- WAIT—we already have Nook (private video sharing)
- Scratch this one.

### 8. **Hearth**
- The center of a home, where warmth comes from
- Where stories are told
- "Come to the Hearth and write"
- **Vibe:** Warm, central, storytelling
- **Concern:** Not especially forest-themed. Also Heartwood is already heart-related.

### 9. **Loft**
- An elevated space, often quiet and private
- Where writers historically worked (garret/loft)
- "I'm up in the Loft working on something"
- **Vibe:** Elevated, private, creative retreat
- **Concern:** Not very nature-themed

### 10. **Bough**
- A main branch of a tree
- Where birds perch to sing
- "Write from the Bough"
- **Vibe:** Connected to the tree (your blog), where voice comes from
- **Concern:** "Writing in the Bough" is awkward

---

## The Ones That Resonate

After sitting with these, **Bower** and **Hollow** stand out:

### Bower
> A bower is a sheltered place—branches woven together overhead, dappled light filtering through, a private retreat within the larger forest. In nature, bowerbirds create elaborate bowers as creative spaces. It's where you go to be alone with your thoughts.

**Test sentences:**
- "Open Bower to write a new post" ✓
- "I spent the morning in Bower" ✓
- "Bower is where my words take shape" ✓

**The feeling:** Creative sanctuary. Intimate. Sheltered. Yours.

### Hollow
> A hollow is a cavity within a tree—a secret space, protected and private. Animals make homes in hollows. It's where you're surrounded by the living wood of your tree.

**Test sentences:**
- "Open the Hollow to write" ✓ (needs "the"?)
- "I've been in the Hollow all morning" ✓
- "The Hollow is where I write" ✓

**The feeling:** Enclosed, private, within the tree itself.

---

## The Decision Point

**Bower** feels more like a creative space—somewhere you go to make things.
**Hollow** feels more like a hiding space—somewhere you go to be alone.

For a writing editor, I think **Bower** captures the creative intent better. You're not hiding in your tree—you're creating something beautiful in a sheltered space.

Also: Bowerbirds are famous for their elaborate constructions. They build bowers to attract and impress. There's something poetic about writers doing the same—crafting words in their bower, hoping someone will be drawn to what they've made.

---

## Final Candidate: Bower

**Bower** — *Creative Sanctuary*

> A bower is a sheltered retreat—branches woven overhead, dappled light filtering through, a private space within the larger forest. Bowerbirds build elaborate bowers as creative spaces, decorating them with treasures to attract admirers.
>
> Bower is where you write. The quiet corner of Arbor where thoughts become posts, where your voice finds its shape. Not a tool, not an editor—a place. Your creative sanctuary within the grove.

*Where words take shape.*

## Conflicts Check

- [ ] Search codebase for "Bower" - need to verify no conflicts
- [ ] Not too similar to existing names (Burrow is close phonetically but different meaning)
- [ ] Subdomain not needed (lives within Arbor)

---

## Alternative to Consider: What About Keeping "Quill" as the Tool Name?

Actually, wait. What if there's a distinction here?

- **Bower** = the *place* (the writing environment, the page)
- **Quill** = the *mode* (the actual typing/editing interface)

Like: "I'm in Bower, using Quill to write"

...but that might be overcomplicating it. The editor is one thing. It should have one name.

Sticking with **Bower**.

## Back to the Drawing Board

Bower is off the table (oversuggested, apparently). Let me think more creatively.

## Fresh Directions

### What if it's INSIDE the tree?

The editor lives within Arbor. Arbor is your tree's control center. So the writing space is *inside* your tree...

- **Hollow** — A cavity within the tree. Private, enclosed, yours alone. "I've been in the Hollow all morning."
- **Heartwood** — Wait, taken (auth). But the concept of writing from the core is nice.
- **Pith** — The soft center of a stem. The core of meaning. Obscure but interesting.

### What if it's about the quiet?

Writers seek solitude. The forest is hushed.

- **Hush** — The quiet of the forest where you hear yourself think. "Open Hush to write." Short, evocative, unusual.
- **Still** — Stillness. But "Write in Still" is awkward.

### What if it's about what you're creating?

Birds build nests. Writers build posts.

- **Nest** — Where you carefully construct something. "I'm working on something in the Nest." Cozy, creative.

### What if it's about the writing surface?

- **Slate** — A clean slate. Fresh start. Natural (stone). "Open Slate to write a new post." Has the "clean slate" idiom built in.
- **Birch** — Birch bark was used for writing across many cultures. Simple, direct. "Write in Birch."

### What if it's about emergence/source?

- **Spring** — Where water emerges, where ideas spring forth. "Open Spring to write." Fresh, generative. (Risk: could mean the season)
- **Wellspring** — More specific but longer.

### What if it's about growth/unfurling?

- **Fern** — Fern fronds unfurl slowly, spiraling open. Like ideas developing. "Open Fern." Short, nature-forward.
- **Frond** — More specific. The unfurling fiddlehead is beautiful symbolism.

### What if it's about a peaceful place?

- **Dell** — A small secluded valley. Peaceful. "Write in the Dell."
- **Glen** — Similar, Scottish vibes.
