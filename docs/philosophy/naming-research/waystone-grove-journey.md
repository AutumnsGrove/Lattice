# A Journey Through the Grove: The Help Center

*Scratchpad for questioning the "Waystone" name*

---

## The Question I'm Carrying

The built-in help center is currently called **Waystone**.
Before that, it was just "help-center."

Waystone was chosen because waystones are markers that guide travelers.
But I need to walk through this forest again and ask:

**Does "Waystone" capture what a help center actually IS?**

Or is it too passive for something that actively helps you?

---

## The Scene

```
                                 ☀️
                              ~/   \~
                            ~/  ☁️   \~
                          ~/          \~
                        ~/ 🌲  🌳  🌲 \~
                      ~/      🌲        \~
                    ~/   🌲       🌲     \~
                   /                       \
                  /    🌲    🏠    🌲       \
                 /         cabin            \
                /      (where help lives?)   \
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
                  ROOTS CONNECT BENEATH
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

---

## Walking Through...

I enter the grove. I'm lost.

Not lost in the "where am I" sense—
**Clearing** tells me the status of things.
**Trails** show me where I'm going.

I'm lost in the "I don't know how to do this" sense.
I want to upload an image to my blog.
I want to change my theme.
I want to understand how billing works.

I need... answers. Knowledge. A guide.

---

## What IS a help center?

Let me sit with this.

A help center is:
- Documentation (knowledge written down)
- Answers to questions (searchable)
- Contextual hints (little "?" buttons that appear where you need them)
- A reference (you go back to it repeatedly)
- Self-service (you find the answer yourself)

It's NOT:
- A conversation (that's Porch)
- A status update (that's Clearing)
- A roadmap (that's Trails)

---

## The Waystone Metaphor

```
         The Forest Path

              🌲         🌲
    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
         🪨              🪨
       waystone       waystone
         ↓              ↓
    "3 miles to     "Meadow
     the river"      this way →"
    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
              🌲         🌲
```

Waystones are:
- **Markers** left along forest paths
- **Passive** - they just sit there
- **Directional** - they point you somewhere
- **Historical** - placed by travelers before you
- **Simple** - just a few words, a direction

When I think of a waystone, I think:
*"Turn left at the stone marker."*

---

## But a help center is different...

When I use a help center, I:
- **Search** for what I need (active query)
- **Read** detailed explanations (not just direction)
- **Click** contextual help buttons (it appears WHERE I'm stuck)
- **Return** to it repeatedly (reference material)

A waystone doesn't answer questions.
A waystone doesn't appear when you're confused.
A waystone doesn't know WHAT you need.

**A waystone is a sign. A help center is a guide.**

---

## The Tension

```
    WAYSTONE                    HELP CENTER
    ════════                    ════════════

    Passive                     Active
    Points direction            Answers questions
    Found on a path             Appears where you need it
    Simple marker               Rich documentation
    One message                 Searchable knowledge
    You walk past it            You interact with it
```

There's a mismatch here.

Waystones are beautiful for navigation—"go this way."
But help centers are about UNDERSTANDING—"here's how this works."

---

## What else could it be?

Let me think about what in nature provides:
- Knowledge
- Answers
- Light in darkness
- Guidance when lost

### The Lantern

```
           ╭───╮
           │ 🔥 │
           ╰─┬─╯
             │
             │
             ─
```

A lantern lights your path when you're lost.
You carry it WITH you.
It illuminates what's in front of you.

But... a lantern doesn't have answers.
It just shows you what's already there.

*Closer, but not quite.*

---

### The Compass

```
          N
        W ✦ E
          S
```

A compass helps you find direction.
You pull it out when you're lost.
It points you toward your destination.

But a compass doesn't explain HOW to get there.
It doesn't have documentation.
It's more about orientation than understanding.

*Still not quite right.*

---

### The Guide

A guide is a person.
They walk with you.
They answer your questions.
They know the forest.

But "Guide" as a name feels too... generic.
And it implies a person, not a system.

We already have Porch for human help.
We already have Wisp for AI assistance.

The help center is neither—it's the written wisdom.

---

## What if I think about it differently?

The help center isn't a thing you FIND.
It's a thing you CONSULT.

Like...
- An elder who knows the forest's history
- A library of forest knowledge
- A well where answers surface
- A tree that remembers everything

---

## The Hollow Tree

```
              🌿🌿
            🌿    🌿
           🌿      🌿
          🌿  ━━━━  🌿
          │   📜   │
          │ answers│
          │  here  │
          │  ▼▼▼   │
          ╰────────╯
              │
              │
         ═════════════
```

A hollow in an old tree—where knowledge is kept.
Where you reach in and find what you need.
Where the forest stores its memory.

**Hollow** as a name?

*"Check the Hollow."*
*"I found it in the Hollow."*

But "hollow" also means empty. That's... not great.
A hollow feeling. A hollow promise.

The connotation might undercut the meaning.

---

## Let me think about light again...

The help center is described as:
> "a lantern to light your path when you're lost"

What if we lean INTO the lantern metaphor?

But instead of calling it Lantern (which is a thing you carry),
what if it's about the LIGHT itself?

### Glow

```
         ╲   │   ╱
          ╲  │  ╱
        ─── ✧ ───
          ╱  │  ╲
         ╱   │   ╲
```

Glow is:
- The light that helps you see
- Warm, not harsh
- Surrounding, not directional
- Always there when you need it

*"The Glow will help you see."*

Hmm. It's soft but maybe too abstract?

---

## What about the THING that glows?

Fireflies glow.
Bioluminescent mushrooms glow.
Phosphorescent moss glows.

### Foxfire

```
         🍄✨  🍄✨
        ✨🍄    🍄
          ✨  ✨
```

Foxfire is the bioluminescent glow of fungi in the forest.
It lights up the dark places.
It's natural, organic, part of the forest itself.

The help center as foxfire—
illuminating the dark corners,
showing you the way forward,
part of the grove itself.

*"Foxfire will light your way."*

---

## Testing the Foxfire Name

> "Foxfire is where you find answers."
> "Check Foxfire for how to do that."
> "The Foxfire says..."

Hmm. It sounds mystical, which fits Grove.
But does it communicate "help documentation"?

When I hear "foxfire," I think of:
- Magic
- Folklore
- The supernatural

Maybe that's beautiful. Maybe it's confusing.

---

## Let me return to the original question.

What does a help center DO that a waystone doesn't?

1. **Answers specific questions** — you search, it responds
2. **Appears contextually** — little "?" buttons where you're stuck
3. **Contains depth** — full articles, not just directions
4. **Teaches** — helps you understand, not just navigate

The verbs are different:
- Waystone: points, directs, marks
- Help center: answers, explains, teaches, illuminates

---

## What about KEEPER words?

The grove has a keeper (that's Autumn, the person).
But what if the help center is like...

### The Keeper's Notes

The accumulated knowledge of everyone who's tended this forest.
Written down. Searchable. Available.

But "Notes" is too utilitarian.

### The Keeper's Wisdom

*"Consult the Keeper's Wisdom."*

But that makes it sound like it's one person's opinion,
not documented knowledge.

---

## What about STRUCTURE words?

Things in the forest that hold knowledge:

### The Archive

Too cold. Too institutional.

### The Library

Better, but libraries are human constructs.
Not very "forest."

### The Roots

```
    ═══════════════════════════════════════
              │   │   │   │   │
              │   │   │   │   │
           KNOWLEDGE RUNS DEEP
    ═══════════════════════════════════════
```

Roots hold the tree up.
Roots remember.
Roots connect everything underground.

But we already use roots conceptually for Mycelium.

---

## Sitting with this...

I keep coming back to the original description:
> "a lantern to light your path when you're lost"

The help center is light. Illumination. Clarity.

What in a forest provides CLARITY?

---

## A Clearing (Already Taken)

Clearing is the status page—where you see what's happening.
That's transparency, not answers.

---

## Dawn?

```
             ☀️
          〰️〰️〰️〰️
        〰️        〰️
      〰️            〰️
```

Dawn is when the forest becomes visible.
When shadows resolve into trees.
When you can finally see where you are.

*"Dawn will make it clear."*

But dawn is a time, not a place or thing.
It's ephemeral—happens once, then it's day.
Help documentation is persistent.

---

## I need to think about the INTERACTION

When you use the help center:

1. You have a question
2. You search or browse
3. You find an article
4. You READ it
5. You understand
6. You go do the thing

It's a **learning** interaction.
Not a conversation. Not a direction.
LEARNING.

What in a forest is about learning?

---

## The Elder Tree

```
                  🌿🌿🌿
               🌿       🌿
             🌿           🌿
            🌿    ~~~      🌿
            │   ~~~  ~~~    │
            │  the stories  │
            │  the wisdom   │
            │  the knowing  │
            ╰───────────────╯
                   │
                   │
            ═══════════════════
```

In forests, the oldest tree knows the most.
It's been through fires and storms.
Its rings record everything.

But we already have **Rings** for analytics.

And an elder tree is still passive—
you can't ask it questions.

---

## Let me reconsider the original: Waystone

Maybe I'm overthinking this.

Waystone DOES communicate guidance.
It DOES say "help is here."
It DOES fit the forest metaphor.

The disconnect is about interactivity:
- Waystones don't answer questions
- Help centers do

But maybe that's okay?

When you're lost in the grove,
you look for the waystone.
It points you to what you need.

In that sense, the help center IS a waystone—
it points you to the right article,
the right answer,
the right path forward.

---

## The Case for Keeping Waystone

```
         You're lost
              │
              ▼
        ╭───────────╮
        │ WAYSTONE  │
        │           │
        │  "How do  │
        │  I upload │
        │  images?" │
        ╰─────┬─────╯
              │
              ▼
        Points you to:
        📄 "Uploading Images to Your Blog"
              │
              ▼
        You follow the path
        You arrive at understanding
```

In this framing, the waystone isn't the ANSWER—
it's the marker that points to the answer.
The documentation articles are the destinations.
The waystone is how you find them.

---

## But wait—that's not quite how it works either.

The help center IS the documentation.
It's not pointing AWAY from itself.
You search it, you read it, you're done.

A waystone points ELSEWHERE.
The help center IS the elsewhere.

---

## What if the name should be about THE KNOWLEDGE, not the guide?

What in nature represents stored knowledge?

- Amber preserves things (but we have Amber for storage)
- Rings record time (but we have Rings for analytics)
- Seeds contain instructions (but seeds are about potential, not reference)

---

## Let me try: LORE

```
              📖
           The Lore
        of the Grove
```

Lore is:
- The accumulated wisdom
- The stories and knowledge
- What everyone who came before knows
- Passed down, written, remembered

*"Check the Lore."*
*"The Lore explains how themes work."*
*"I found it in the Lore."*

Grove Lore. The Lore of the Grove.

---

## Testing Lore

> "Lore is where you find answers."
> "The Lore will help you understand."
> "When in doubt, consult the Lore."

I like this. Lore feels:
- Deep (accumulated knowledge)
- Natural (forests have lore, legends, stories)
- Respectful (the word has weight)
- Searchable (you can search lore)

But wait—"lore" usually refers to STORIES and LEGENDS.
Is help documentation really "lore"?

"How do I upload an image" isn't lore.
"How billing works" isn't lore.

Lore is usually about history and narrative,
not practical how-to guides.

---

## Hmm. Let me think about what IS practical forest knowledge.

If you were learning to survive in a forest:
- Which berries are safe to eat
- How to find water
- Which direction is north
- How to build shelter

This is **woodcraft**. **Forestcraft**. **Survival knowledge**.

But those words are clunky for a name.

---

## What about PATHS?

We have Trails for personal roadmaps.
But paths are also... routes to understanding.

*"Follow the path."*

But Path feels too generic.

---

## Circling back: What makes Waystone work?

It's simple. It's visual. It's forest-appropriate.
"When you're lost, look for the waystone."

The weakness is passivity.
But maybe that's okay for documentation.

Documentation IS passive.
It sits there. You go to it.
It doesn't come to you (except for contextual hints).

---

## But there ARE those contextual help buttons...

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  Upload Image                       │
    │                                     │
    │  [Choose File]         [?]          │
    │                         ↑           │
    │          This little button         │
    │          brings help TO you         │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

When you click that [?], Waystone appears.
It comes to you. It's contextual.
That's not passive—that's responsive.

Maybe the contextual help buttons are like...
little waystones scattered throughout the interface.
Each one a marker. Each one points to knowledge.

---

## I think I'm talking myself back to Waystone.

Let me draw the full picture:

```
    THE GROVE HELP SYSTEM
    ═════════════════════════════════════════════

    WAYSTONE (Self-Service Docs)
         │
         ├── Searchable articles
         ├── Contextual [?] buttons
         ├── In-app documentation
         └── "A lantern for when you're lost"

    PORCH (Human Connection)
         │
         ├── Support tickets
         ├── Conversations with the keeper
         └── "Have a seat, let's talk"

    CLEARING (Status & Transparency)
         │
         ├── System status
         ├── Incident history
         └── "See what's happening"
    ═════════════════════════════════════════════
```

This trio works:
- **Waystone** = self-service answers
- **Porch** = human help
- **Clearing** = system status

---

## The Final Question: Is Waystone ACTIVE enough?

Waystones in real life are passive markers.
But Grove's Waystone is:
- Searchable (you query it)
- Contextual (it appears where you need it)
- Rich (full articles, not just directions)

Maybe Grove's Waystone is a magical waystone.
One that responds to your questions.
One that appears when you're confused.
One that holds knowledge, not just directions.

---

## What if we lean into the magic?

Waystones in fantasy often ARE magical.
They teleport you. They speak. They guide.

Grove's Waystone could be:
> "A waystone that speaks when asked.
> Not just a marker—a keeper of paths,
> ready to light your way."

---

## Testing the tagline

> "Waystone is where you find your way."

That works. It's about finding direction AND understanding.

> "When you're lost, look for the Waystone."

That works too. It invites you to seek help.

> "The Waystone knows the paths."

Hmm, that's nice. It has knowledge. It guides.

---

## The Alternatives, Ranked

| Name | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| **Waystone** | Forest metaphor, guidance, already named | Traditionally passive |
| **Lore** | Deep knowledge, accumulated wisdom | Better for stories than how-tos |
| **Foxfire** | Beautiful, illuminating | Obscure, might confuse |
| **Glow** | Warm, helpful | Too abstract |
| **Lantern** | Light in darkness | A carried object, not a place |

---

## My Conclusion

**Waystone stays.**

Here's why:

1. **The name fits the ecosystem.** Waystone sits alongside Porch (human help) and Clearing (status) as part of the guidance trio.

2. **The passivity is acceptable.** Documentation IS passive. It waits for you. That's okay.

3. **The contextual buttons are mini-waystones.** Those [?] buttons throughout the interface are little markers—each one a waystone that points to knowledge.

4. **The alternative names don't fit better.** Lore is for stories. Lantern is carried. Foxfire is obscure. Waystone is clear.

5. **It's already named and live.** Renaming has cost. The current name works well enough.

---

## If I Were to Change It...

If I HAD to pick something else, I'd consider:

### Beacon

```
           🔥
          ━━━━
         ╱    ╲
        ╱      ╲
       ╱        ╲
      ────────────
```

A beacon is:
- A signal fire
- Something that helps you find your way
- A point of light in darkness
- ACTIVE (it burns, it calls)

*"Follow the Beacon."*
*"The Beacon will guide you home."*

Beacon is more active than Waystone.
It's about being FOUND, not just marking.

But beacon also implies distress, emergency.
Help documentation is everyday, not crisis.

---

## Final Decision: Keep Waystone

```
                    🪨
                ╱▔▔▔▔▔╲
               │ WAY   │
               │ STONE │
               │       │
               │  ⟡    │   ← The marker glows
               │       │     when you approach
               ╲▁▁▁▁▁╱
         ═══════════════════════
              The Forest Floor
```

**Waystone** stays.

It's:
- A marker for when you're lost
- A guide to the knowledge you need
- Part of the grove's navigation system
- Simple, clear, forest-appropriate

The weakness (passivity) is actually a feature—
documentation IS passive. That's its nature.
The [?] buttons throughout the interface are
the active part, little waystones that appear
where you need them.
