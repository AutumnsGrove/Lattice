# *A Vision Document*

## Why This Exists

The internet used to be a place of personal expression. Geocities. Angelfire. Blogs with personality. Somewhere along the way, we traded that for algorithms, engagement metrics, and platforms that own our words.

Grove.place is a return to something simpler. A place where people can plant their thoughts and watch them grow. No ads. No tracking. No algorithmic feeds deciding who sees what. Just writers and readers, meeting in a digital grove.

## The Vision

*A forest of voices.* Every Wanderer is a tree in the grove. Some are saplings just starting out. Some are ancient oaks with deep roots. All are welcome. All have space to grow.

The platform should feel like walking through a peaceful forest at golden hour. Calm. Intentional. A refuge from the noise of social media.

# Core Values

## Accessibility

Everyone deserves a voice online. Pricing should never be the barrier that stops someone from sharing their story. The basic tier exists so that anyone who wants to write can afford to write.

**Your writing is for the world.** Grove blogs are publicly accessible by default—no login required, no paywall, no barriers. This is the open web as it should be. (Those who need private blogs for professional use can opt into login-required access at the Evergreen tier.)

## Ownership

Your words are yours. Your data is yours. You can export everything, anytime. If you leave, you take your roots with you.

## Simplicity

No feature bloat. No endless settings. Write in Markdown. Upload images.
Publish. That's it. The technology should disappear into the background.

## Community With Care

Intentionally queer-friendly. Welcoming to all. No engagement metrics breeding outrage. No viral mechanics rewarding the loudest voice. Just people, sharing what matters to them.

## AI Sanctuary

Your words are not training data. Grove blocks every AI crawler, every scraper, every "search agent" that wants to harvest content for machine learning models. [Cloudflare stands at the gate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/additional-configurations/block-ai-bots/), and our corner of the web becomes a black hole to external AI. Learn more about [how Grove protects your content from AI scraping](https://grove.place/knowledge/help/how-grove-protects-your-content).

This matters more than it might seem. As AI systems vacuum up the public web, genuine human expression becomes fuel for machines that simulate humanity. Grove refuses to participate. What you write here stays here, read by humans, not ingested by algorithms.

We do use AI internally for content moderation, but intentionally: with zero data retention, with privacy-first providers, with no training on your words. There's a difference between using a tool carefully and feeding a machine indiscriminately. We choose the former while rejecting the latter.

*Your voice remains yours. Not a dataset. Not a statistic. Yours.*

# On Community — Meadow

## A forest is not a collection of isolated trees.

Beneath the surface, roots intermingle. Trees share nutrients through mycorrhizal networks, the 'wood wide web' that connects an entire forest into a single living organism. The oldest trees nurture the saplings. The dying trees feed the soil for those that come after.

## Meadow is the roots.

It's optional. Your blog exists independently, complete on its own. But if you choose, you can connect. Follow friends, see their posts in a simple chronological feed, leave reactions that only they can see.

## What Makes This Different

1. **No public metrics.** Follower counts aren't displayed. Like counts don't create hierarchies. Your worth isn't measured by engagement.

2. **No algorithm.** The feed is chronological. Your friends' posts appear in order. Nothing is hidden or boosted based on 'engagement potential.'

3. **Private encouragement.** Reactions and comments are visible to the author only. Feedback becomes encouragement, not performance.

4. **Full control.** Want to see friends' posts but disable interactions on yours? Fine. Want to hide from discovery entirely? Fine. Every setting is yours to configure.

5. **Built on open standards.** Your blog isn't locked into Grove. The connections between blogs use the same portable technology that powers podcasts and news readers. If you ever leave, your followers can still follow you wherever you go.

*Encouragement without performance. Connection without competition.*
