# What I Believe

*A Declaration*

---

## The Garden That Was

The internet used to be a garden.

Not a manicured one—a wild one. Full of weird little corners and handmade pages. You could stumble onto someone's space and feel like you'd discovered something. A stranger's thoughts, laid out with care, just for you to find.

I remember that feeling. Finding someone's cozy corner and thinking: *I want something like this.*

---

## The Walls

Then the walls went up.

Garden walls, at first. Then higher. Then so high you couldn't see another garden on the horizon. The gardens disappeared into isolated biospheres—entirely self-consuming voids where the only way out was through a gate someone else controlled.

Friends scattered to different platforms and became unreachable unless you followed them there. Some I can only talk to on one app—that's the only place they'll respond. Others I've lost entirely. People I met in games, in communities, in spaces that don't exist anymore.

I had music saved from artists I loved. One song I can still hum but will never hear again—the artist deleted it, lost the file themselves. Gone. Screenshots from games I played as a kid. Blog posts I'd bookmarked. Proof I existed somewhere, vanished.

*That's what the walls took. Not just content. Connection. Memory. Proof.*

---

## The Machines

I'm tired of watching my friends get trapped in dopamine slot machines designed to exploit how our minds work.

I signed up for a platform to see my friends. Instead I got 40,000 strangers the algorithm decided I should see instead. Reels, shorts, infinite scroll—engineered to hijack attention, especially neurodivergent attention.

Platforms that built their empires on our words, then loosened protections for people like us the moment it became profitable.

I think that's **disgusting.**

---

## The Bridge

Grove is everything that isn't.

I want to build a bridge—between people and other people, between you and your own data. I want you and your words to hold hands, not be separated by a company's database.

There's a search engine called Kagi. You pay for it. It doesn't show you ads. It doesn't track you. When you search, you just... search.

That's how Grove works.

You pay for a place to write. I don't sell your attention to anyone. Your words are just words. There's the membership, and that's it.

---

## The Choices

Grove is text and photos only. That's not a limitation—it's a choice.

I want people to be intentional about what they post. Short-form video is ruining our attention spans—mine included. So I'm not building another place for content to disappear into an infinite scroll.

No algorithms deciding who sees your words. No engagement metrics breeding outrage. No viral mechanics rewarding the loudest voice.

Just people, sharing what matters to them.

---

## Queer-Friendly Infrastructure

I believe in queer-friendly infrastructure.

In safe digital spaces, especially when physical ones feel hostile.

I'm building this because I want somewhere that's intentionally welcoming. Somewhere that won't suddenly decide we're not worth protecting.

---

## Ownership

Your words belong to you—not to platforms that lock them in, not to algorithms that decide who sees them, not to AI companies that harvest them without asking.

At any point, you can download everything. Not just when you leave—**always.** Your content lives in standard formats that work anywhere. Markdown files you can take to any platform.

**Your voice remains yours.** Not a dataset. Not a statistic. **Yours.**

---

## The Century

Your words could outlive you.

On most platforms, they'd vanish the moment you stopped paying—or the moment the company decided to pivot, or shut down, or get acquired.

Here, if you grow with Grove long enough, your grove earns **Centennial status**—your site stays online for a hundred years. Even after you're gone, if you want it to.

*A hundred years is roughly how long an oak tree lives.*

---

## Building Slowly

I'm building this slowly, with care, without venture capital pressure to enshittify.

Grove is a forest, not a factory.

**I grow at the pace of roots.**

*This is [solarpunk](/knowledge/help/what-is-solarpunk) thinking.*

---

## The Feeling

When someone signs up for Grove, I want them to feel **empowered.**

Like they've found a launching point for something good. Like they're planting something that could grow for years. Like their words are safe here.

Grove is not trying to be everything.

It's trying to be **somewhere.**

*A quiet corner.*

*A place to be.*

---

## Welcome

This is my manifesto.

Not a pitch. Not a promise of features. A statement of what I believe.

And if you believe it too—

**Welcome to the Grove.**

---

*But loss isn't the whole story. See [Grove's Vision](/vision) for what we're building toward, or [Why I Built the Grove](/knowledge/philosophy/why-i-built-the-grove) for the personal story behind it all.*
