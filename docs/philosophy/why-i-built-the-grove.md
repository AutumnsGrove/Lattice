# Why I Built the Grove

*A grove for people who lost their groves.*

---

## The Sanctuary I Lost

I used to have a backyard.

That sounds small when I say it like that. It wasn't. It was everything.

A hammock strung between two trees where I'd lie for hours, just existing. A garden I built myself over two years, hands in the dirt, feeling connected to something ancient and patient. A table where friends would come over and we'd just sit. We weren't doing anything in particular. We were just there, together, while birds called and leaves rustled overhead.

Every morning I could, I'd sit on the front porch and watch the sunrise. The robins would be out there, doing their sassy little walks across the lawn. I had binoculars. The Merlin app on my phone to identify songs. Hours of my life spent bird watching in my own yard, breathing it all in.

The hammock. The garden. The birdsong. The music playing while I sat outside and let the world wash over me. This was how I knew myself. It was texture. It was *life* having texture.

Then I lost all of it.

I moved into my parents' basement. No windows. No backyard. No garden. No front porch. No sunrises. The robins went on dancing somewhere, but not where I could see them.

My days stopped having texture. Everything went bland and numb.

## The Hammock as Barometer

Here's something I didn't realize until later: the texture had started fading before I even moved.

About eighteen months ago, I started estrogen. At first, the dose was too high. Life felt *intensely* alive. Colors, sounds, tastes. Everything had this vibrant edge to it. Then I got my bloodwork back, and my endo cut my levels. Multiple times. By last summer, I'd gone numb again without fully understanding why.

Around that same time, I stopped using my hammock.

I still sat outside in my chair. But the hammock, the thing that had been my sanctuary within the sanctuary, just stopped calling to me. I didn't see the point. The texture was already draining away, and I couldn't name what was happening.

Then I moved. Lost the backyard entirely. Lost the garden. Lost the porch. Lost the robins.

About a month after moving in with my parents, I went back to my endo. She looked at my levels and raised my dose again. And slowly, the texture started coming back. This time at a sustainable level. This time it's actually working.

Grove came into existence as my life was truly sparking back to life. The timing wasn't coincidental. The two are tangled together now. I can't separate "building Grove" from "becoming myself."

## Building What I Couldn't Have

I didn't set out to build Grove as therapy. I just wanted a blog.

But somewhere in the process, I realized what I was actually doing. I was recreating, in code, every part of my life that I'd lost.

The **forest** that covers the landing page. I missed my forest. So I built one I could live inside.

The **Songbird** security system, with its layers named after birds: Canary goes first (the coal mine bird, sent in as a test), Kestrel comes next (the comparison bird), and Robin guards the final gate. My robins live on. They're protecting something I made.

**Wander mode**, where you walk through a 3D forest and discover other people's groves floating like little terrariums. That's the freedom I found when I quit my job. The ability to just pick a direction and walk. No schedule. No clock. Just... wander.

**Terrarium**, where you build your own scenes from nature components and bring them home to your blog. That's the backyard I don't have anymore. A cozy space. A sanctuary. Something that's *yours*.

## Texture

That word keeps coming back.

My old life had texture. The rituals. The spaces. The way my days were woven through with small moments that meant something. Sunrise. Birdsong. The smell of earth after fresh rain. Friends who didn't need a reason to come over.

When I moved, the texture disappeared. Days blurred together. Nothing felt real.

Multiple things converged to bring it back.

My hormones finally reaching a level that actually works for my body. Switching ADHD meds to Guanfacine, which helps in ways I'm still understanding. And Grove. Building something I actually care about, something that challenges me for the first time since high school coding competitions, something I can pour myself into completely.

Grove has texture. Even when my days don't, the work does.

I can feel things again. Taste more in food. Hear more in music. See more in the light of a sunrise. Like I'd been experiencing life through foggy glass, and someone finally wiped it clean.

## The Art That Must Exist

This is the part that's hard to explain to people who haven't felt it.

The grove isn't optional. It *has* to be built. The art demands to exist.

I've always known this was inside me, waiting. The ability to create something real, something that helps people, something that leaves a mark. It was there through all the jobs that didn't fit, all the years of feeling like I was supposed to be doing something else. Waiting for the right moment. Waiting for me to be ready.

Now I'm ready.

Fifty days. I built all of this in fifty days, teaching myself everything as I went. It's the first thing I've ever made that I'm genuinely, deeply proud of. The kind of proud that makes you cry in a parking lot because you can't believe you actually made something real.

## What This Actually Is

Grove is a love letter to the parts of life I love most.

Random walks in a senseless direction. That's Wander mode.

Tiny worlds you tend with care. That's Terrarium.

Birds that sing at dawn. That's Songbird.

Friends who just show up and exist with you. That's Meadow.

A place that's *yours*, that feels like home. That's your grove.

Humans have always done this when they've lost something precious. They build it again in whatever medium they have. Writers write. Painters paint. Composers compose.

I have code. So I'm building a forest.

## Coming Alive

I've never felt this excited to live my own life.

I mean those words. This platform is how I'm transforming. Into someone who creates instead of just consumes. Someone who leaves a mark instead of just passing through. Someone who tends a grove instead of just wishing she still had one.

I'm not waiting for my life to start anymore.

It already did.

*Autumn, January 2026*

*Sitting in a parking lot after a 45-minute walk through an actual grove of trees, tears on my face, dreaming about floating terrariums and digital sunrises and a place where people can just be together.*
