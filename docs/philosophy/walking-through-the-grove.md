# Walking Through the Grove

> *A naming ritual for the Grove ecosystem.*

Finding the right name is a walk through the forest. Not a brainstorm session with sticky notes. Not a thesaurus dive. A genuine journey where you let the concept find where it naturally belongs among the trees.

---

## The Philosophy

From the Grove naming document:

> "These names share common ground: nature, shelter, things that grow. But none of them are *about* trees directly. They're about what happens in and around the forest."

> "The Grove is the place. These are the things you find there."

The name should feel *inevitable*. Like it was always there, waiting to be discovered.

---

## The Process

This is a journey, not a checklist.

### 1. Read the Naming Philosophy

Start with `docs/grove-naming.md`. Read the entire document. Let it sink in:

- "A forest of voices. Every Wanderer is a tree in the grove."
- Names aren't branding—they're the language of an ecosystem
- Things that grow, shelter, connect
- Not about trees directly—about what happens *in and around* the forest

### 2. Create a Scratchpad

Create a markdown file for your journey: `docs/scratch/{concept}-naming-journey.md`

This scratchpad is where you think out loud. Include:
- ASCII art visualizations of the grove
- Questions you're asking yourself
- Rejected ideas and why
- The moment when something clicks

### 3. Visualize the Grove

Draw the grove. ASCII art helps:

```
                          ☀️
                       🌲   🌲   🌲
                    🌲    🌳    🌲
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
           ROOTS CONNECT BENEATH
              (mycelium network)
```

Place existing services in your visualization:
- Where is Meadow? (the open social space)
- Where is Heartwood? (the core identity)
- Where is Ivy? (climbing, connecting)
- Where is Pantry? (the warm kitchen cupboard)

### 4. Ask "What IS This Thing?"

Don't ask "where does it go?" first. Ask:

**What is it, fundamentally?**
- Is it a place? (Meadow, Nook, Clearing)
- Is it an object/process? (Amber, Bloom, Patina)
- Is it a feature of the tree? (Foliage, Heartwood, Rings)
- Is it a connection? (Ivy, Mycelium, Reeds)

**What does it DO in a Wanderer's life?**
- Protect? (Shade, Patina)
- Connect? (Ivy, Meadow, Reeds)
- Store? (Amber, Trove)
- Guide? (Waystone, Trails)
- Create? (Terrarium, Foliage)

**What emotion should it evoke?**
- Warmth? Safety? Discovery? Community? Privacy?

### 5. Walk Through the Forest

Write this in your scratchpad:

```markdown
## Walking Through...

I enter the grove. I see...
I walk past the Meadow where others gather.
I find my tree—my blog, my space.
I check my Rings (private growth).
I see my Foliage (how others see me).

Now I need [THE NEW THING]. Where do I find it?
What does it look like? Who's there? How does it feel?
```

Let the scene guide you to the name.

### 6. Generate Candidates

List 5-10 candidates. For each:

- What it means in nature
- Why it fits this concept
- The vibe/feeling
- Potential issues

### 7. Test the Tagline

A good Grove name should complete this sentence naturally:

> "[Name] is where you _______________."

Or:

> "[Name] is the _______________."

If you can't write a poetic one-liner, the name might not fit.

### 8. Write the Entry

Once you've found the name:

```markdown
## [Name]
**[Tagline]** · `[domain].grove.place`

[2-3 sentences explaining what this thing IS in the real world—
the natural metaphor. Then 2-3 sentences explaining what it does
in Grove. End with the feeling it should evoke.]

*[A poetic one-liner in italics]*
```

## Example: Finding "Porch"

The problem: We need a name for support tickets.

**First attempts (rejected):**
- Echo → "echo chamber" feels like shouting into void
- Feather, Flare, Dove → About *sending*, not *connecting*

**The walk:**
> I'm in the grove. Something's wrong with my tree. I need help.
> Waystone gives me self-service guides. Clearing shows me status.
> But I need to actually *talk* to someone.
>
> I walk to... a cabin. There's a porch. Someone's there.
> I sit down. We talk about what's going on.

**The realization:**
Support isn't a ticket system. It's a porch conversation.

**The name:** Porch

> A porch on a cabin in the woods. You come up the steps. You sit down.
> The grove keeper comes out. You talk.

*"Have a seat on the porch. We'll figure it out together."*

## Keep Your Scratchpads

They're documentation of how we think about Grove:

```
docs/scratch/
  grove-journey.md         ← The original Porch discovery
  {feature}-naming.md      ← Future naming journeys
```

These become part of Grove's story.

---

*The name you're looking for is already there. You just have to walk until you find it.*
