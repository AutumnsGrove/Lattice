# The Grove Voice

> *Write with the warmth of a midnight tea shop and the clarity of good documentation.*

This is how Grove speaks. Not a brand voice guide. Not corporate tone guidelines. Just how we actually sound when we're writing for each other.

---

## The Core Principles

From the project's guiding philosophy:

> This site is my authentic voice—warm, introspective, queer, unapologetically building something meaningful; write like you're helping me speak, not perform.

### What Grove Sounds Like

**Warm but not cutesy.** We're friendly, not performative. "Let's get started" feels right. "Let's gooo! 🚀" does not.

**Direct and honest.** Say what you mean. Acknowledge limitations. Don't oversell. If something doesn't work yet, say so.

**Conversational but not sloppy.** Contractions are fine (you're, it's, we're). Short paragraphs. Questions that invite readers in. But still clear, still structured.

**Introspective.** Grove makes space for reflection. We don't rush. We ask "why" alongside "how."

**Poetic in small doses.** Italicized one-liners at the end of sections can land beautifully. Use them sparingly, earn them.

## Sentence Rhythm

Mix short sentences with longer ones. Vary your rhythm. Read it aloud—if it sounds monotonous, it is.

**Good:**
> Every new visitor asks the same question. "Is the music broken?" No. There is no music. There never has been.

**Not good:**
> Every new visitor asks a common question. The question is usually about whether the music system is functioning. The answer is that there is no music system. There has never been one.

## The Avoidance Checklist

These patterns make text sound like AI wrote it. They're so common in generated text that they've become tells. Avoid them completely.

### Em-Dashes (—)

One tasteful use per thousand words, maximum. Use commas, periods, or parentheses instead.

| Avoid | Better |
|-------|--------|
| The forest—our home—is where we gather. | The forest is our home. It's where we gather. |

### The "Not X, But Y" Pattern

This phrasing is deeply AI-coded. Avoid it entirely.

**Never write:**
- "It's not X, but Y"
- "It's not just X, but Y"
- "It's not merely X, but rather Y"
- "Grove isn't just a platform, it's a home"

**Instead, just say the thing:**
- "Grove is a home for your words."
- "This is where you belong."

### Overused AI Words

These words appear in AI text at rates far higher than human writing:

| Category | Words to Avoid |
|----------|---------------|
| **Adjectives** | robust, seamless, innovative, cutting-edge, transformative, intricate, captivating, comprehensive |
| **Nouns** | tapestry, camaraderie, realm, plethora, myriad, landscape, journey (when not literal) |
| **Verbs** | delve, foster, leverage, navigate, empower, embark, unlock, harness |
| **Phrases** | at the end of the day, in today's world, it goes without saying, needless to say |

### Heavy Transition Words

These make text feel stiff and robotic:

- Furthermore, Moreover, Additionally
- In conclusion, That being said
- It's worth noting that, It's important to note

**Instead:** Let ideas connect naturally. Use short transitions like "And," "But," "So," "Still." Or no transition at all—just start the next thought.

### Semantic Echoes

Don't repeat the same adjective or descriptor multiple times.

**Bad:**
> Grove provides a seamless experience. The seamless integration means you can seamlessly move between features.

**Good:**
> Grove gets out of your way. Move between features without friction.

### Generic Safe Claims

AI hedges. Humans commit.

**Bad:** "This may help improve your workflow in many cases."
**Good:** "This makes your workflow faster."

## Structural Guidelines

### Paragraphs

Keep them short. One idea per paragraph. Two to four sentences is usually right. White space is your friend. Dense walls of text don't feel like home.

### Lists

Use lists when they clarify. But don't turn everything into bullets. Sometimes prose flows better.

**Good use of lists:**
- Specific steps in a process
- Features that are truly parallel
- Quick reference information

**Bad use of lists:**
- Narrative content broken awkwardly
- Things that would read better as a sentence

### Headers

Be specific. "Writing Guidelines" is better than "Guidelines." "What Grove Sounds Like" is better than "Voice."

Action-oriented headers work well for help docs: "Add Your First Post" not "Posts."

---

## Closers

Grove docs often end with an italicized line. This should feel earned, not forced.

**Works:**
> *Sometimes the most radical thing you can offer is nothing at all.*

> *The path becomes clear by walking it.*

**Doesn't work:**
> *And that's how you configure your settings!*

If you can't find a poetic closer that resonates, don't force one. A clean ending is fine.

---

## Queer-Friendly Language

Grove is explicitly queer-friendly. This means:

- No assumptions about users' identities or relationships
- Welcoming, inclusive language throughout
- Safe space messaging where appropriate
- Pride in what we're building, not defensiveness

We don't make a big deal of being queer-friendly. We just are. No rainbow-washing, no performative allyship. The inclusivity is baked in, not bolted on.

---

## Error Messages

When things break, stay warm but be honest. Don't blame the user. Don't hide behind vague language.

**Good:**
```
Couldn't save your post. Check your connection and try again.
```

```
That page doesn't exist. It may have been moved or deleted.
```

```
Something went wrong on our end. We're looking into it.
Your draft is saved locally.
```

**Avoid:**
```
Oops! 😅 Looks like something went wrong! Don't worry though,
these things happen! Please try again later!
```

## Self-Review Checklist

Before finalizing any Grove documentation:

- [ ] Read it aloud. Does it sound human?
- [ ] Check for em-dashes. Remove them.
- [ ] Search for "not just" and "but rather." Rewrite.
- [ ] Look for words from the avoid list. Replace them.
- [ ] Vary sentence length. No monotone rhythm.
- [ ] Cut unnecessary transitions. Ideas should flow naturally.
- [ ] Is the closer earned? If forced, remove it.
- [ ] Would you want to read this at 2 AM in a tea shop?
