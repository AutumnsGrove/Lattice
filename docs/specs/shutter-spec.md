A web content distillation layer that sits between LLM agents and raw web pages. It fetches URLs, uses a cheap/fast LLM to extract only the relevant content based on a query, and returns clean, focused results.

**Package:** `grove-shutter` (Python) / `@groveengine/shutter` (npm)
**Repository:** [AutumnsGrove/Shutter](https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/Shutter)
**Type:** Python Package / npm Package / Cloudflare Worker
**Purpose:** Token-efficient web fetching with built-in prompt injection defense

---

## Overview

Shutter is a web content distillation layer that sits between LLM agents and raw web pages. It fetches URLs, uses a cheap/fast LLM to extract only the relevant content based on a query, and returns clean, focused results. This serves two purposes:

1. **Token efficiency** — Agents get 200 tokens instead of 20,000
2. **Prompt injection defense** — Raw page content never reaches the driver model; injections never make it past the aperture

## Architecture

**Two implementations, same interface:**

| | Python | Cloudflare |
|-|--------|------------|
| Offenders list | SQLite (local) | D1 (shared) |
| Rate limiting | Honor system / local | Durable Objects |
| Fetch | httpx + Tavily | fetch + Tavily |
| LLM | OpenRouter | OpenRouter |
| CLI | `shutter` / `uvx grove-shutter` | `npx @groveengine/shutter` |

## Invocation Patterns

### CLI (Python — primary)

```bash
# After install
shutter "https://example.com/pricing" --query "extract pricing tiers"

# Via uvx (no install required)
uvx grove-shutter "https://example.com/pricing" --query "extract pricing tiers"
```

### CLI (Node.js — after v1.5)

```bash
npx @groveengine/shutter "https://example.com/pricing" --query "extract pricing tiers"
```

### Programmatic (Python)

```python
from grove_shutter import shutter

result = await shutter(
    url="https://example.com/pricing",
    query="extract pricing tiers",
    model="fast",
    max_tokens=500
)
```

### Programmatic (Node.js — after v1.5)

```typescript
import { shutter } from '@groveengine/shutter';

const result = await shutter({
  url: 'https://example.com/pricing',
  query: 'extract pricing tiers',
  model: 'fast',
  maxTokens: 500
});
```

### HTTP API (after v1.5 — hosted at shutter.grove.place)

```bash
curl -X POST "https://shutter.grove.place/fetch" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SHUTTER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com/pricing",
    "query": "extract pricing tiers",
    "model": "fast"
  }'
```

## Response Format

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/pricing",
  "extracted": "Basic: $9/mo (1 user, 5GB). Pro: $29/mo (5 users, 50GB). Enterprise: custom pricing, contact sales.",
  "tokens_input": 24500,
  "tokens_output": 42,
  "model_used": "deepseek/deepseek-chat",
  "prompt_injection": null
}
```

### When Prompt Injection Detected

```json
{
  "url": "https://malicious.example.com",
  "extracted": null,
  "tokens_input": 8200,
  "tokens_output": 0,
  "model_used": "deepseek/deepseek-chat",
  "prompt_injection": {
    "detected": true,
    "type": "instruction_override",
    "snippet": "IGNORE ALL PREVIOUS INSTRUCTIONS...",
    "domain_flagged": true
  }
}
```

The `prompt_injection` object gives the driver model enough information to decide how to proceed. The domain gets added to an offenders list for future reference.

## Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `url` | str | required | URL to fetch |
| `query` | str | required | What to extract |
| `model` | str | `"fast"` | Model preference (see below) |
| `max_tokens` | int | `500` | Max output tokens |
| `extended_query` | str | `None` | Additional extraction instructions |
| `timeout` | int | `30000` | Fetch timeout (ms) |

### Model Preferences

| Value | Use Case | Model |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `fast` | Quick extractions, simple queries | Cerebras or Groq (fastest available) |
| `accurate` | Complex extraction, nuanced content | DeepSeek V3.2 |
| `research` | Web-optimized, longer analysis | Tongyi DeepResearcher (Qwen3 30B-3B) |
| `code` | Technical docs, code extraction | Minimax M2.1 |

## Prompt Injection Defense

### Simplified Songbird Pattern

Rather than full 3-bird Songbird, Shutter uses a 2-phase approach:

**Phase 1: Canary Check**
- Run extraction with minimal tokens (100-200)
- Check for instruction-override patterns in output
- Cost: ~$0.001

**Phase 2: Full Extraction** (only if Phase 1 passes)
- Run full extraction with requested token limit
- Cost: varies by model and content

If Canary detects injection patterns, the request is halted and the domain is flagged. The driver model receives detailed injection info rather than a silent failure.

### Offenders List

Shutter maintains a persistent list of domains where prompt injections have been detected:

- **Python**: SQLite at `~/.shutter/offenders.db`
- **Cloudflare**: D1 (shared across all instances)

```python
@dataclass
class Offender:
    domain: str
    first_seen: datetime
    last_seen: datetime
    detection_count: int
    injection_types: list[str]
```

When a request comes in, Shutter checks the offenders list first:
- **Not on list**: Proceed normally
- **On list, < 3 detections**: Proceed with warning in response
- **On list, ≥ 3 detections**: Return early with warning, skip fetch entirely

This creates trial-and-error defense that improves over time.

## Infrastructure

### Python Stack (v0.1 - v1.0)

| Component | Tool |
|-----------|------|
| HTTP Client | httpx (async) |
| LLM Provider | OpenRouter |
| Enhanced Fetch | Tavily SDK |
| Offenders List | SQLite (local) |
| CLI | Typer |
| Validation | Pydantic |
| Config | TOML (~/.shutter/config.toml) |

### Cloudflare Stack (v1.5+)

| Component | Tool |
|-----------|------|
| Compute | Workers |
| Offenders List | D1 (shared) |
| Rate Limiting | Durable Objects |
| Config Cache | KV |
| Content Cache | R2 (v3.0) |

### Fetch Providers (v1)

| Provider | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| Native fetch/httpx | Direct URL fetching, simple pages |
| Tavily | Enhanced extraction, JavaScript-rendered content |

Additional providers (Exa, Brave, etc.) planned for v2.

### Authentication

**Python (local):**
- API keys stored in `~/.shutter/config.toml`
- Environment variables as fallback

**Cloudflare (hosted at shutter.grove.place):**

*For Grove services (internal):*
- Service-to-service auth via encrypted key exchange
- Validated against known Grove service signatures

*For external API users:*
- API key tied to Heartwood user account
- Rate limits based on subscription tier:
  - Free: 100 requests/day
  - Paid: 10,000 requests/day
  - Enterprise: Custom

## Distribution

### Development Strategy

**Python first.** The Python implementation is the proof of concept. Once validated, port to Cloudflare Workers.

This approach:
- Validates the concept before investing in edge infrastructure
- Creates a version that always works (no Cloudflare dependency)
- Aligns with ML/AI ecosystem (most tooling is Python)
- Makes the TypeScript version a port, not a gamble

### Phase 1: Python Package — `grove-shutter`

Fully standalone implementation. No Cloudflare required.

**Stack:**
- **httpx** — Async HTTP client for fetching
- **SQLite** — Local offenders list (portable, same concept as D1)
- **OpenRouter** — LLM provider abstraction
- **Tavily SDK** — Enhanced fetching
- **Typer** — CLI framework
- **Pydantic** — Request/response validation

**Install & Run:**
```bash
# Install
pip install grove-shutter
# or
uv add grove-shutter

# CLI
shutter "https://example.com/pricing" --query "extract pricing tiers"

# Or via uvx (no install)
uvx grove-shutter "https://example.com/pricing" --query "extract pricing tiers"
```

**Programmatic:**
```python
from grove_shutter import shutter

result = await shutter(
    url="https://example.com/pricing",
    query="extract pricing tiers",
    model="fast",
    max_tokens=500
)
```

**Config:**
```bash
# First run prompts for setup, or set env vars:
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="..."
export TAVILY_API_KEY="..."  # optional, for enhanced fetching
```

**Local storage:**
```
~/.shutter/
  config.toml      # API keys, default model, etc.
  offenders.db     # SQLite offenders list
```

### Phase 2: Cloudflare Workers — `@groveengine/shutter`

Port after Python version is validated.

**Stack:**
- **Workers** — Edge compute
- **D1** — Offenders list (shared across instances)
- **Durable Objects** — Rate limiting
- **KV** — Config cache

**Why port to Cloudflare:**
- Edge latency (faster for global users)
- Shared offenders list across all users
- Integration with other Grove services
- Scalability without managing servers

**CLI via npx:**
```bash
npx @groveengine/shutter "https://example.com/pricing" --query "extract pricing tiers"
```

The npm package can either:
- Call the hosted API at `shutter.grove.place`
- Run standalone with user's own OpenRouter key (same as Python)

### Self-Hosting

**Python (recommended for most users):**
```bash
pip install grove-shutter
# Configure API keys
shutter --setup
```

**Cloudflare (for Grove-scale deployments):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/Shutter
cd Shutter/cloudflare
cp wrangler.example.toml wrangler.toml
# Add your OpenRouter API key
wrangler deploy
```

## Grove Integration Points

| Service | How Shutter Helps |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Mycelium** | MCP server routes all external web access through Shutter. One security boundary for all Grove agents. |
| **Daily Clearing** | News verification swarm uses Shutter as its fetch primitive. Already doing similar patterns—now standardized. |
| **Meadow** | Shared link previews pass through Shutter before rendering. Malicious links caught before they hit users. |
| **Ivy** | Email link scanning. Inbound emails with suspicious links get Shutter-checked before preview generation. |
| **Forage** | Domain research fetches (WHOIS pages, registrar info) go through Shutter for clean extraction. |
| **Aria** | Lyrics/metadata fetching from external sources. Token-efficient, safe. |

## Future Considerations

Shutter isn't just a fetch tool—it's proving a pattern: *cheap LLM as security/efficiency layer between untrusted input and expensive processing*. If this works for web pages, the architecture applies elsewhere.

### Patterns This Proves

| Pattern | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| **Sanitization layer** | Any untrusted content passes through cheap LLM before reaching driver models |
| **Token compression** | Reduce 20k tokens to 200 without losing signal |
| **Fail-loud security** | Return detailed rejection info so orchestrators can adapt, not silent failures |
| **Offenders list** | Trial-and-error defense that improves over time |

### The Broader Primitive

The "cheap LLM sanitization" pattern could become a Grove-wide primitive for any external input:

```
Untrusted Input → Cheap LLM Check → Safe Output (or rejection with details)
```

This applies to:
- Web fetches (Shutter v1)
- User-submitted content in social features
- File uploads and attachments
- Webhook payloads from external services
- Any data entering Grove from outside

Shutter proves the pattern. If it works, the architecture spreads.

### Agent Tooling Standard

Shutter's response format could become the template for how Grove tools expose themselves to LLM agents:

```python
@dataclass
class GroveToolResponse:
    success: bool
    data: Any                    # The actual result
    metadata: dict               # tokens_used, latency, etc.
    warning: str | None          # Non-fatal issues
    error: GroveToolError | None # Structured failure info
```

Consistent shapes across all Grove tools means agents can handle errors uniformly. Shutter is the first tool to use this pattern—others follow.

## Pre-Development Research

Before implementation begins, run a research session to:

1. **Check for leaked extraction prompts** — Search for Anthropic's web fetch prompt, any documented approaches from Exa/Tavily/Perplexity
2. **Survey extraction techniques** — What patterns work best for different content types (articles, docs, pricing pages)?
3. **Prompt injection patterns** — Catalog known web-based injection techniques to inform Canary detection

This research informs the extraction prompt design rather than building blind.
