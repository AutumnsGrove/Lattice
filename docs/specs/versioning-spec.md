# Lattice — Versioning Specification

> **Deprecated:** This spec has been consolidated into **[Seasons — Versioning System](seasons-spec.md)**, the canonical versioning reference for the Grove package ecosystem.

All content previously here — semantic versioning strategy, publishing workflow, update propagation, breaking change protocol, and changelog management — now lives in the Seasons spec. This file is preserved for existing links.

_Consolidated: February 2026_
