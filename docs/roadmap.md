## Full Bloom: Wisp — Writing Assistant

> *A helper, not a writer*

**Status:** Implementation complete, pending deployment

Wisp is Grove's ethical AI writing assistant. It helps polish your voice without replacing it—grammar checks, tone analysis, readability scores. Never generation, never expansion, never brainstorming.

### Implementation Complete
- [x] Model configuration (DeepSeek V3.2 via Fireworks AI)
- [x] Inference client with provider fallback cascade
- [x] Local readability calculations (Flesch-Kincaid)
- [x] API endpoint (`/api/grove/wisp`)
- [x] Rate limiting (20 req/hour, $5/month cap)
- [x] WispPanel UI component with ASCII vibes
- [x] WispButton toolbar integration
- [x] Database migration (`014_wisp.sql`)
- [x] Migration prompt for AutumnsGrove

### Deployment Tasks (Pre-Launch)
- [ ] Run database migration: `wrangler d1 execute <db> --file=packages/engine/migrations/014_wisp.sql`
- [ ] Set Fireworks AI API key: `wrangler secret put FIREWORKS_API_KEY`
- [ ] (Optional) Set backup provider keys: `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`
- [ ] Add default settings to D1: `wisp_enabled=false`, `wisp_mode=quick`
- [ ] Deploy updated GroveEngine package to npm
- [ ] Run AutumnsGrove migration (see `docs/specs/wisp-migration-prompt.md`)

### AutumnsGrove Migration Tasks
- [ ] Update component imports to use `WispPanel` from groveengine
- [ ] Update settings page to Wisp branding
- [ ] Change API endpoint from `/api/ai/writing-assist` to `/api/grove/wisp`
- [ ] Update setting keys: `ai_assistant_enabled` → `wisp_enabled`
- [ ] Remove old files: `AIWritingPanel.svelte`, `ai-models.js`, `api/ai/writing-assist/`

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Settings page loads, toggle works
- [ ] Usage stats display correctly
- [ ] Grammar analysis returns suggestions
- [ ] Tone analysis returns traits
- [ ] Readability calculates locally (no API call)
- [ ] Apply fix functionality works
- [ ] Rate limiting enforces correctly
- [ ] Cost cap warning appears at 80%

### Documentation
- [x] Unified spec: `docs/specs/writing-assistant-unified-spec.md`
- [x] Migration guide: `docs/specs/wisp-migration-prompt.md`
- [x] Grove naming: Added to `docs/grove-naming.md`
- [ ] User guide for settings panel

### Privacy & Philosophy
- All features OFF by default (opt-in only)
- Zero Data Retention (ZDR) from all inference providers
- Content analyzed, never stored
- Outcome-only retention (scores, not content)
- User's voice is sacred — we polish, never replace

*Like a will-o'-the-wisp in the forest — light, airy, guiding without forcing.*
