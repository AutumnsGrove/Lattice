# Grove Email: Version 6 (Support Announcement)

*Created: January 21, 2026*

---

## Context

First email sent from autumn@grove.place (previous emails came from Autumn's personal address). Announces the support page at grove.place/support. Keeps it brief, no pressure, just making people aware the option exists.

**The tone:** Quiet, honest, not salesy. "Here's a thing, if you want it."

---

## Final Email Draft

**Subject:** A way to support the grove

---

Quick one.

I set up a support page: [grove.place/support](https://grove.place/support)

No pressure, no pitch. If Grove means something to you and you want to help keep it running, the option is there. One-time, no account needed.

Also: this is the first email from my new Grove address. autumn@grove.place is officially home now.

\- Autumn
