## Reading Blogs

**Everyone can read Grove blogs. No login required.**

All blogs are publicly accessible by default. You don't need an account to read someone's writing. Just visit their blog and read.

**Meadow** (the community feed) requires a free account to browse and interact.

**Privacy option for Evergreen:** Only users on the Evergreen tier can choose to make their blog require login to view. For everyone else, blogs remain publicly accessible.

### What "Public" Means

When you publish a post on Grove (on any tier except Evergreen with privacy enabled), your content is:

- **Visible to anyone** who visits your blog URL
- **Indexed by search engines** (though AI crawlers are blocked)
- **Shareable** via direct links
- **Available via RSS feed** for anyone to subscribe

This is by design. Grove is about sharing your voice with the world. If you need a private blog for client work, internal documentation, or paid memberships, the Evergreen tier provides login-required access controls.

---

## Free Tier (Wanderer)

_Your first steps in the grove._

Free accounts get:

- **Blog:** 25 published posts at `username.grove.place`

- **Meadow access:** Browse the community feed, react to posts, leave replies
- **Comment on posts:** Leave replies (private) and comments (public) on blogs you follow
- **Public comment limit:** 20 per week (private replies are rate-limited)

Free is for the curious. Write, share, see if this is home. When you're ready to grow, take root with Seedling.

**Community Themes (Oak+):** Browse and import themes created by other Grove users.

---

## Vines (Sidebar Links)

Vines are sidebar links that appear alongside your blog posts. Perfect for linking to related posts, sources, further reading, or anything you want readers to explore.

Available to all paid tiers. See the [Vines documentation](/help/writing/vines) for more.

---

## Comments

Grove supports two types of interaction on blog posts:

- **Replies (private):** Only the blog author sees these
- **Comments (public):** Visible to everyone after author approval

| Tier      | Public Comments | Private Replies |
| --------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Free      | 20/week         | Rate limited    |
| Seedling+ | Unlimited       | Unlimited       |

Blog authors control who can comment on their posts and moderate all public comments before they appear.

---

## Custom Domains

### Bring Your Own Domain (Oak+)

Already have a domain? Connect it to your Grove blog at no extra cost. Available on Oak and Evergreen tiers.

### Domain Search Service (Evergreen)

Don't have a domain yet? Our AI-powered domain search tool finds the perfect domain for your blog—turning what's normally a 2-week search into 1-2 hours.

| Turnaround | Setup Fee |    Credited As     |
| :--------: | :-------: | :----------------: |
|  Same Day  |   $200    | 4 months Evergreen |
|   3 Days   |   $100    | 2 months Evergreen |
|   1 Week   |    $50    | 1 month Evergreen  |

**Setup fees are credited toward your subscription**: you're not losing money, you're prepaying for service.

**Domain registration** (~$20/year for standard domains) is included in your Evergreen subscription for domains up to $100/year. Premium TLDs over $100/year: you cover the difference.

### Your Domain, Your Ownership

When we register a domain for you, **you own it**. If you ever leave Grove:

- Transfer your domain to any registrar
- We provide authorization codes within 48 hours
- No transfer fees, no hostage situations

See our [Data Portability & Separation Policy](https://grove.place/knowledge/legal/data-portability-separation) for full details.

## Centennial Status

_Some trees outlive the people who planted them._

Centennial is Grove's promise that your words can have the same longevity. After 12 cumulative months on Sapling tier or above, your grove earns **Centennial status** — your site stays online for 100 years from the day you planted it.

### How It Works

| Path to Centennial              | Timeline                   |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Yearly subscription (Sapling+)  | Instant upon first renewal |
| Monthly subscription (Sapling+) | After 12 monthly payments  |
| Mixed (upgrade/downgrade)       | Cumulative months counted  |

### What Centennial Means

- **100-year domain reservation** — Your `name.grove.place` is yours for a century
- **Content preservation** — Published posts remain publicly accessible
- **Read-only archive** — If you stop paying, your site becomes a static archive (no new posts, but everything stays online)
- **Reactivate anytime** — Resume your subscription to regain full access

### Opting Out

Not everyone wants their words to outlive them. Centennial is automatic once earned, but you can:

- **Disable preservation** in account settings
- **Delete your account** for full removal
- **Transfer to a successor** (future feature)

For full technical details, see the [Centennial Specification](/knowledge/specs/centennial-spec).

**How we keep this promise**: The 100-year guarantee isn't just words—it's backed by Grove's financial structure, including The Reserve (a dedicated sustainability fund) and succession planning. See [How Grove Lasts](/docs/grove-sustainability) for the full breakdown.
