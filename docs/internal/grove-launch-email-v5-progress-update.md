# Grove Launch Email: Version 5 (Progress Update)

*Created: January 12, 2026*

---

## Context

A week past the "shortly after January 5th" timeline from v4. This email explains where things stand: business is done, platform is hardened, but logo and testing remain before opening the doors. Tone is warm, honest, focused on getting people in.

**The tone:** Quick update energy with substance. "Here's what's really going on behind the scenes."

## Final Email Draft

**Subject:** A week later. Here's where things stand.

A week past "shortly after." Here's where things stand.

The business is officially registered. EIN, mailing address, all of it. Grove is real.

On the platform side: I rebuilt how sign-in works, and it's so much better now. Ran a full security pass to make sure your words stay yours. Tested everything. Tightened everything. Made it ready for real people to actually use.

Still building. Every single day.

I've also been sketching out what comes next. If you're curious, there's a workshop page: [grove.place/workshop](https://grove.place/workshop)

But first, let's get you in the door.

Before I open the doors:

I'm working on a fresh logo. The current one needs to go, and the new one will feel more... Grove.

And I need to do a full testing pass. Not just "does it work" but "does it work *well*." Signing up, writing a post, uploading images, the whole journey. I want your first experience to be smooth, not "sorry, we're still fixing things."

Mid-January.

— Autumn

## Voice Notes

- Opens with callback to v4's "shortly after" language
- Honest about what's done vs what's left
- "Grove is real" emphasizes legitimacy
- "Still building. Every single day." shows ongoing commitment
- Workshop tease gives curious people somewhere to go
- "Let's get you in the door" keeps focus on launch
- Logo framed as intentional improvement, not mistake
- Testing framed as caring about their experience
- "Mid-January" is specific enough without locking in a date
- No em dashes anywhere

```
