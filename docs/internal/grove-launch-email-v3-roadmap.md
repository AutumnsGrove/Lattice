# Grove Launch Email — Version 3 (Roadmap Announcement)

*Created: December 26, 2025*

---

## Context

The roadmap page is live at grove.place/roadmap. It's a visual journey through Grove's development phases, with seasonal theming (snow, petals, falling leaves) and procedural tree generation. This email invites subscribers to explore it.

**The moment:** Grove is in the "Thaw" phase. The roadmap shows where we've been, where we are, and where we're going — all the way to Midnight Bloom (the dream of a physical tea shop).

**The goal:** Get people to visit and explore the roadmap. Let the page speak for itself.

## Final Email Draft

**Subject:** Come see where we're going

---

I built a roadmap.

Not a spreadsheet with dates. Not a Notion page with checkboxes. An actual journey. Seasons changing as the grove grows.

**→ [grove.place/roadmap](https://grove.place/roadmap)**

You'll start in First Frost (the foundations). Right now we're in Thaw. The doors are opening. Scroll down to watch the grove grow through spring, summer, autumn... and eventually, a dream that glows in the dark.

It's the kind of thing you might want to explore slowly.

— Autumn

## Voice Notes

- Short, punchy sentences
- No em dashes (Autumn's preference)
- Invites curiosity without over-explaining
- "A dream that glows in the dark" references Midnight Bloom without spoiling it
- Trust the page to do the heavy lifting

---

## Visual Notes

- No screenshot needed — the page IS the visual
- The roadmap has its own "wow" factor with seasonal animations
- Let people discover it themselves
