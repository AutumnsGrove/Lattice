# Grove Launch Email — Version 4 (Delay Notice)

*Created: December 31, 2025*
*Updated: January 1, 2026*

---

## Context

Grove's launch is delayed because the IRS is closed until January 5th, preventing Autumn from getting an EIN to officially register the business. This email is honest about the reason without being overly technical.

**The tone:** Grounded, honest, a little wry. Respects their time.

## Final Email Draft

**Subject:** A small delay

---

Quick update:

The IRS is closed until January 5th, so I can't get an EIN to officially start the business yet. (Of course they'd be closed the week I'm ready to launch.)

Signups will open shortly after they're back. Almost there.

— Autumn
