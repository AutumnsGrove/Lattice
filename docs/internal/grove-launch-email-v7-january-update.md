# Grove Launch Email: Version 7 (February Launch Announcement)

*Created: January 31, 2026*
*Updated: February 4, 2026*

---

## Context

Almost a month since the last email (v5 on January 12). Subscribers were told "mid-January" and it's now February. This email delivers good news: we're launching sooner than the cautious "end of February" we'd planned. Beta on Feb 7th, public on Feb 14th (Valentine's Day!).

**The tone:** Feelings-first, but now with concrete dates and excitement. We under-promised and over-delivered.

## Final Email Draft

**Subject:** February 7th. The doors open.

---

It's been a minute.

I've been in the code all month. Not just adding things. Making it feel *right*.

Login feels reliable now. The kind of reliable where you don't think about it. You just get in.

Your words feel safer. Everything sensitive is encrypted in ways I can actually explain to you now.

When something's wrong, you can tell me. Inline, on a dedicated page, or through Porch: direct conversations when you need real support. You won't feel like you're shouting into a void.

The admin tools feel real now. A proper Flow editor. A status page. Documentation that actually helps.

And I moved payments back to Stripe. Simpler. More reliable. Ready.

**When can you come in?**

February 7th. Small group first.

If you want to be in that first wave, reply to this email. I'd love to show you around.

Then February 14th: the doors open for everyone. A place to be on the day of love. Felt right.

If you want to help keep the lights on: [grove.place/support](https://grove.place/support). And I'm on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/groveplace.bsky.social) now.

\- Autumn

## Voice Notes

- Opens with acknowledgment of silence without over-apologizing
- Focuses on how things FEEL, not what was built
- "The kind of reliable where you don't think about it" is peak Grove voice
- "You won't feel like you're shouting into a void" addresses a real fear
- Stripe mention is brief but shows progress and simplification
- Concrete dates (Feb 7, Feb 14) replace vague promises
- "I'd love to show you around" is warmer than just "reply to this email"
- Valentine's Day launch: "A place to be on the day of love. Felt right."
- Support and Bluesky asks are low-pressure, at the end
