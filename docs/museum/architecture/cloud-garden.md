# The Cloud Garden

> *Cloudflare primitives composing like instruments in an orchestra.*

## What You're Looking At

This exhibit explains how Grove's Cloudflare infrastructure works together. Workers handle compute, D1 stores data, KV provides caching, and R2 stores media.

---

## The Composition

| Primitive | Role | Analogy |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Workers** | Compute | The musicians |
| **D1** | Persistent storage | The sheet music |
| **KV** | Fast cache | The rehearsal room |
| **R2** | Object storage | The instrument cases |

---

## Why It Matters

By building entirely on Cloudflare's primitives, Grove runs at the edge globally with minimal operational complexity. No VMs to maintain, no containers to orchestrate.
