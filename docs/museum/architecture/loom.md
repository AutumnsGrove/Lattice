## What You're Looking At

This exhibit explains Loom, Grove's Durable Objects coordination layer. Cloudflare Durable Objects provide stateful coordination primitives that enable real-time features, auth coordination, and D1 batching.

---

## The Pattern

Loom weaves together:
- **Auth coordination**: Sessions, tokens, device fingerprinting
- **Real-time state**: WebSocket connections, live updates
- **D1 batching**: Efficient database operations

---

## Why It Matters

Traditional serverless is stateless. Durable Objects give Grove the coordination capabilities of traditional servers while maintaining the scaling benefits of serverless infrastructure.
