# The Media Vault

> *R2 storage for images and files.*

## What You're Looking At

This exhibit explains how Grove stores media using Cloudflare R2. Images, documents, and other files are stored securely with global distribution.

---

## The Pattern

**Validation**: Images are validated before storage

**Deduplication**: Content-hash prevents duplicate storage

**CDN Delivery**: Files are served through Cloudflare's CDN

**Tenant Isolation**: Each tenant's media is isolated

---

## Why It Matters

R2 provides S3-compatible storage without egress fees. Your images load fast worldwide, and you're not charged for bandwidth.
