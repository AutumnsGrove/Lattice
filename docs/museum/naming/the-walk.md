# The Walk

> *Finding the right name is a walk through the forest.*

## What You're Looking At

This exhibit explains the naming ritual. You don't brainstorm Grove names in a conference room with sticky notes. You take a walk through the forest, visualize the concept, and let it find where it naturally belongs.

---

## The Ritual

1. **Create a visualization scratchpad** — ASCII art of the forest
2. **Step into the metaphor** — The Grove is the place, these are the things you find there
3. **Walk through locations** — Where does this concept live?
4. **Test the name** — Does it complete the tagline naturally?
5. **Document the journey** — Rejected names teach as much as chosen ones

---

## The Test

A name passes if it sounds natural in sentences:

- "Check Heartwood to see if you're logged in" (natural)
- "Heartwood verified your identity" (natural)
- "The authentication module checked credentials" (doesn't fit Grove)
