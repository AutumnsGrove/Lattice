# The Ecosystem Map

> *40+ services, each with its nature metaphor.*

---

## What You're Looking At

This exhibit maps Grove's entire naming ecosystem. Every service, every feature, every concept has a name that fits naturally into the forest metaphor.

---

## The Map

| Service | Role | Why This Name |
|---------|------|---------------|
| **Lattice** | Core framework | Structure that supports growth |
| **Heartwood** | Authentication | Dense core where trust lives |
| **Loom** | Durable Objects | Weaves threads together |
| **Meadow** | Community feed | Open gathering space |
| **Clearing** | Status page | Visibility and transparency |
| **Porch** | Support system | Where conversations happen |
| **Grafts** | Feature flags | Attaching new growth |
| **Curios** | Personalization | Collected treasures |
| **Foliage** | Theme system | The visible canopy |

## Why It Matters

Consistent naming creates a world. When everything fits the metaphor, the platform feels coherent and intentional. Words create worlds.
