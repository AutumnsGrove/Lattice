# Journey: Porch

> *The origin story that created the naming ritual.*

---

## What You're Looking At

This is the naming journey for Porch, Grove's support system. This journey created the naming ritual itself. Support isn't a ticket system. It's a porch conversation.

---

## The Concept

A support system where conversations feel human. Not tickets and queues, but sitting down and talking through problems together.

---

## The Walk

*Support... where does support happen in a grove?*

Not inside the house. That's too formal. Not in the garden. That's work.

The porch. You come up the steps. Have a seat. The grove keeper comes out to chat.

---

## Rejected Names

- **Help Desk** — too corporate
- **Support Center** — too clinical
- **Grove Help** — doesn't fit the metaphor

---

## Why It Works

"Come up to the Porch if you need help."
"Autumn's on the Porch if you have questions."

It sounds like home.
