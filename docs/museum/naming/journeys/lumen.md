# Journey: Lumen

> *A difficult journey between light and void.*

---

## What You're Looking At

This is the naming journey for Lumen, Grove's AI gateway. A difficult journey that explored the tension between the hollow center (where everything flows) and illumination (what emerges).

---

## The Concept

A unified AI routing layer. Every AI request passes through this center: moderation, generation, images. One interface, intelligent routing.

---

## The Walk

*An AI gateway... what is this in the forest?*

In anatomy, a lumen is the hollow center of a tube. The void through which everything flows.

But lumen also means light. Illumination.

Both meanings fit. The void through which requests pass, and the light that emerges from AI processing.

---

## The Decision

It came down to trying names in sentences:

"Lumen routed the request to the right model."
"Check Lumen's logs for the AI call."

Natural. Clean. The double meaning adds depth rather than confusion.
