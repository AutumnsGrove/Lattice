# Journey: Loom

> *Sometimes you walk through the forest and realize the name you started with was right all along.*

## What You're Looking At

This is the naming journey for Loom, Grove's Durable Objects coordination layer. A walk that explored many options before returning to where it started.

---

## The Concept

A coordination layer using Cloudflare Durable Objects. Weaving together auth, state, and real-time features.

---

## The Walk

*Coordination... threads... weaving...*

The concept already had its name. Loom. A frame where threads come together. Where patterns emerge from individual strands.

But I walked anyway, exploring:
- **Web** — too Spider-Man
- **Weave** — already used for something else
- **Thread** — too generic
- **Spindle** — too specific

---

## Returning Home

After the walk, Loom was still the answer. The framework where Grove's threads come together. Sometimes the first instinct is right.
