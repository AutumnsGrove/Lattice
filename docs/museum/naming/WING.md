# The Naming Wing

> *How Grove names things, and why it matters.*

## What You're Looking At

This wing explains Grove's naming philosophy. Names aren't branding; they're world-building. Every service has a nature metaphor that genuinely fits. Each name was discovered through a walk through the forest.

## Featured Journey

**Porch**: Support isn't a ticket system. It's a porch conversation. You come up the steps, have a seat, and the grove keeper comes out to chat. This journey created the naming ritual.
