## What You're Looking At

This exhibit explains Grove's session management. Sessions refresh silently using the halfway pattern. Device fingerprinting coordinates multiple tabs. You stay logged in without thinking about it.

---

## The Pattern

**Halfway Refresh**: Sessions extend when actively used, halfway through their lifetime. If you're active, you stay logged in. If you're away, you'll need to log in again.

**Multi-Tab Coordination**: Open Grove in multiple tabs? They coordinate through Loom so you don't get logged out of one while using another.

---

## Why It Matters

Good session management is invisible. You shouldn't have to think about authentication once you've logged in. Sessions should just work.
