# The Security Checkpoint

> *Protection that happens without frustration.*

## What You're Looking At

This exhibit explains Grove's security measures. Rate limiting prevents abuse. CAPTCHA appears only when necessary. Protection works in the background so you can focus on writing.

---

## The Layers

**Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse without blocking legitimate use

**CAPTCHA**: Appears only when behavior looks suspicious

**Input Validation**: Everything is sanitized before processing

**Audit Logging**: Security events are tracked for investigation

---

## Why It Matters

Security doesn't have to feel hostile. Grove protects without making visitors feel surveilled. The goal is safety that's invisible until you need it.
