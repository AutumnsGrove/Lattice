> *The dense core of a tree, where trust lives.*

## What You're Looking At

This exhibit explains Heartwood, Grove's authentication system. Named for the dense inner core of a tree, Heartwood handles Google OAuth, magic links, and everything that establishes your identity.

---

## The Flow

1. You click "Sign in with Google"
2. PKCE flow secures the OAuth handshake
3. Your identity is verified
4. A session is created
5. You're in

---

## Why It Matters

Authentication is the foundation of trust. Heartwood uses industry-standard security (PKCE, rate limiting, audit logging) while keeping the experience simple and non-threatening.
