## What You're Looking At

This exhibit explains the Clearing, Grove's status page at status.grove.place. When something goes wrong, or when maintenance is planned, you can see exactly what's happening.

---

## The Transparency

**Real-time Status**: Current health of all Grove services

**Incident History**: Past issues and how they were resolved

**Planned Maintenance**: Advance notice of scheduled work

**Subscribe to Updates**: Get notified when status changes

---

## Why It Matters

Transparency builds trust. When Grove has problems, we don't hide. The Clearing shows exactly what's happening, what we're doing about it, and when we expect it to be resolved.
