## What You're Looking At

This exhibit explains Meadow, Grove's community feed. Blogs can optionally share posts to a shared space where Wanderers can discover new voices, react with emojis, and find their next favorite writer.

---

## The Features

**Opt-in Sharing**: Share posts to the feed if you want, or keep your blog private

**Discovery**: Find new blogs through shared posts

**Reactions**: Emoji reactions let readers respond without comments

**Voting**: Surface the best content through community voting

---

## Why It Matters

Community is opt-in. Your blog is yours first. Meadow exists for those who want to be discovered, but no one is forced into the spotlight.
