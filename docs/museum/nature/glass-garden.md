## What You're Looking At

This exhibit explains Grove's glassmorphism design system. Glass surfaces create hierarchy while hinting at beauty beneath. The effect is like looking through frosted windows at a forest.

---

## The Pattern

- **Glass surfaces** with subtle blur and transparency
- **Nature backgrounds** visible beneath the glass
- **Soft shadows** that create depth without harshness
- **Warm colors** that maintain Grove's cozy feeling

---

## Why It Matters

Glassmorphism isn't just aesthetic. It creates visual hierarchy while preserving the nature elements that make Grove feel alive. Content floats above the forest without obscuring it.
