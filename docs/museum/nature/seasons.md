## What You're Looking At

This exhibit explains Grove's seasonal theming system. Four natural seasons plus a hidden fifth create distinct moods throughout the platform.

## The Seasons

| Season | Mood | Colors |
|--------|------|--------|
| **Spring** | Renewal, fresh starts | Soft pastels, new greens |
| **Summer** | Growth, vibrance | Bright greens, warm yellows |
| **Autumn** | Harvest, reflection | Warm oranges, deep browns |
| **Winter** | Rest, quiet | Cool blues, soft whites |
| **Midnight** | Dreams, queerness | Deep purples, rose accents |

## Finding Midnight

Cycle through seasons in the theme picker. Keep going past Winter. Midnight is Grove's queer aesthetic, a celebration of dreams and identity.
