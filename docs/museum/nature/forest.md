# The Forest

> *64 mathematically-driven SVG components with customizable Svelte props.*

---

## What You're Looking At

This exhibit showcases Grove's nature component library. Every tree, creature, and weather effect is an SVG built with mathematical precision and customizable through Svelte props.

---

## The Components

**Trees**: Cherry, Pine, Aspen, Oak, Birch, Maple, Willow, and more

**Creatures**: Bee, Butterfly, Deer, Fox, Owl, Rabbit, Squirrel

**Weather**: Rain, Snow, Falling Leaves, Falling Petals, Fireflies

---

## Why It Matters

The nature system creates organic variety from precise parameters. Each component can be tuned through props, meaning no two forests are exactly alike while all maintain visual coherence.
