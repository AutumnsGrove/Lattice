# Social Media Strategy

> **Purpose**: Guide for establishing Grove's presence on external platforms
> **Philosophy**: Set up signposts in the forest that say "Exit this way →"
> **Goal**: Minimal time investment, maximum signposting to grove.place

## The Uncomfortable Truth

You don't have to *live* on these platforms. But you need a presence there to guide people OUT. Think of each account as a trailhead sign pointing toward the actual forest.

Every post should ultimately direct people to grove.place — your platform, your rules, your home.

---

## Platform Priority Matrix

| Priority | Platform | Audience | Strategy | Time Investment |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **1** | Bluesky | Tech-forward Twitter refugees, indie web | Primary presence. Most aligned with Grove values. Growing writer community. | Medium |
| **2** | Mastodon | FOSS advocates, privacy-conscious, indie web | Your people. Small but devoted. Cross-post from Bluesky. | Low |
| **3** | Twitter/X | Broad reach, tech community | Reluctant but necessary for discovery. Post and leave. Don't engage with toxicity. | Low |
| **4** | Instagram | Visual creators, younger audience | Aesthetic showcase (forest screenshots, seasonal themes, Terrarium). Less text-heavy. | Low |
| **Skip** | TikTok | Gen Z, short-form video | Not aligned with Grove's intentional, text-first ethos. Skip entirely. |
| **Skip** | LinkedIn | Professional networking | Wrong audience. Skip. |
| **Skip** | Facebook | General public | Dying platform, wrong demographic. Skip. |

## Posting Cadence

### Launch Phase (First 2 weeks)
- Daily posts across platforms
- Coordinated launch announcements
- Respond to every genuine reply
- High engagement, establish presence

### Sustain Phase (Ongoing)
- 2-3 posts per week
- Scheduled via Buffer/similar tool
- Batch content creation (1 hour/week)
- Check replies 1x daily, respond selectively

### The "Don't Live There" Rules
1. Schedule posts in advance
2. Set specific times to check (not all day)
3. Reply to genuine interest only
4. Ignore trolls completely (don't even read)
5. Every session ends by closing the app
6. Your real work happens on Grove, not on Twitter

---

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Do:
- Speak in first person ("I built this because...")
- Be unapologetically values-forward
- Use "I believe in..." statements
- Call out what you're against (be specific)
- Invite people into something
- Show vulnerability (the real story)
- Use nature metaphors naturally

### Don't:
- Use corporate marketing speak
- Say "we" when it's just you (be honest about solo dev)
- Engagement-bait ("What do YOU think?")
- Argue with bad-faith critics
- Apologize for having values
- Water down the manifesto energy

### The Grove Voice Examples

❌ "Grove is a modern blogging platform with privacy-first features."
✅ "I built Grove because I'm tired of watching my friends get trapped in dopamine slot machines."

❌ "Our AI protection feature blocks unwanted crawlers."
✅ "Your words are not training data. I blocked ClaudeBot even though I built this with Claude. Principles matter."

❌ "Join our community of writers!"
✅ "If you remember when the internet felt like a garden of weird personal spaces — I'm trying to bring that back."

## Metrics That Matter (And Don't)

### Track:
- Click-throughs to grove.place
- Signups attributed to social
- Meaningful conversations started
- Community sentiment

### Ignore:
- Follower count (vanity metric)
- Like counts (dopamine trap)
- Viral potential (not the goal)
- Engagement rate (wrong game)

### The Real Metric
**Are people finding their way to the grove?**

If yes, social is working. If no, adjust the signposts.

---

## Tools

- **Scheduling**: Buffer, Typefully, or native scheduling
- **Cross-posting**: Consider tools that post to Bluesky + Mastodon simultaneously
- **Link tracking**: UTM parameters to know which platform drives traffic
- **Image creation**: Screenshots from grove.place, Figma for custom graphics

---

## Emergency Playbook

### If a post goes viral:
1. Don't panic
2. Pin the most important link (grove.place)
3. Respond to genuine questions
4. Ignore the noise
5. Get off the platform when overwhelmed

### If you get attacked/trolled:
1. Don't respond
2. Block liberally
3. Remember: they're not your audience
4. Your people are the ones who feel relief reading your posts

### If you burn out on social:
1. It's okay to go quiet
2. Schedule a few evergreen posts
3. Focus on the actual product
4. Social is a tool, not a requirement
5. Grove itself is the proof — social is just the signpost

*Remember: You're not building an audience on Twitter. You're building a forest, and occasionally leaving trail markers so people can find their way in.*
