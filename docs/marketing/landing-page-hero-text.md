## Main Headline

**The internet used to be a garden.**

## Subheading

Grove is a quiet corner of the web where your words can grow. Your own subdomain, no AI training, no algorithms, no ads. Just you and your voice.

## Body Copy

Remember when the internet felt personal? When you had your little corner of it. When you weren't performing for an algorithm. When your words belonged to you.

I built Grove because I think we can have that again.

For the past month, I've been coding non-stop (with AI agents and determination) to create a blogging platform that gives you **yourname.grove.place**, blocks AI crawlers from stealing your content, and lets you export everything if you ever want to leave.

But more than that, it's built for people like us. Neurodivergent folks who hate the endless customization rabbit holes. Queer people who want safe digital spaces. Anyone who's tired of being the product.

**Your words are yours. Not a dataset. Not a statistic. Yours.**
