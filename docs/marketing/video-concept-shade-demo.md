## Title

**"I Built a Blogging Platform That Blocks AI Crawlers — Here's How"**

---

## Video Outline

### [0:00-0:15] Opening

"Most platforms are desperate for AI traffic. I built one that tells AI to fuck off. Let me show you."

---

### [0:15-1:00] The Problem

Show examples of AI crawlers in server logs.

"These bots are scraping your content to train models you didn't consent to. Your blog posts become training data."

---

### [1:00-2:00] The Solution (Shade)

Demo of grove.place admin panel. Show the Cloudflare bot rules configuration.

"This blocks GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, and 50+ other AI scrapers."

---

### [2:00-3:00] Live Demonstration

Screen recording showing:
- Normal browser → works perfectly
- curl with AI bot user-agent → blocked
- The "Quick Check" protection page
- Server logs proving the block

---

### [3:00-3:30] The Technical Bits

"Built on Cloudflare's edge network. Uses Durable Objects for sessions. SvelteKit frontend. All the modern performance without the surveillance."

---

### [3:30-4:00] Why This Matters

"Your words should be yours. Not a dataset. Not a statistic. Yours. I'm not just building a platform, I'm building a refuge."

---

### [4:00-4:30] Call to Action

"Launching this week. grove.place. For people who think the internet can be better."

---

## B-roll Ideas

- Terminal windows with server logs
- Cloudflare dashboard showing bot blocks
- Actual blog posts being published
- The Grove admin panel in action

---

## On-screen Text

## Production Notes

- Keep under 5 minutes for HN/social sharing
- Record terminal demos of Shade blocking
- Use screen recorder for Cloudflare dashboard walkthrough
- Show actual server logs with bot blocks
- Consider timing: authentic energy, not overly polished
