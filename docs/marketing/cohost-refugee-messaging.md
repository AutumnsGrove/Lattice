# Cohost Refugee Messaging

*Reaching the displaced community from "the last meaningful refuge of the queer internet"*

---

## Context

**What happened:** Cohost shut down January 12, 2025, after announcing in September 2024 they couldn't sustain operations. They had ~30K monthly active users but only 2,630 paying subscribers — not enough to survive.

**Who they were:** Cohost was described as "the last meaningful refuge of the queer internet" — a place where queer and marginalized users could be "unashamedly weird and uncompromisingly themselves."

**Where they went:** Dispersed to Tumblr, Pillowfort, Bluesky, Mastodon, Dreamwidth, Neocities, Discord. No single platform captured the community.

**The opportunity:** It's been ~6 months. They're still looking for home. Grove is what they were looking for.

## Why Grove Resonates with Cohost Users

| What Cohost Had | What Grove Has |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Queer-friendly space | Explicitly queer, built by a queer person |
| No algorithms | Chronological feed, no manipulation |
| Anti-engagement-metrics | Private reactions, no public counts |
| Long-form friendly | Blog-first, not microblogging |
| Community feel | Meadow — private encouragement model |
| Weird/creative freedom | Nature aesthetic, seasonal themes, personality |
| Values-driven | Solarpunk-aligned, anti-surveillance |

**What Grove adds that Cohost didn't have:**
- **Centennial** — Your blog lives 100 years (Cohost died in 3)
- **Sustainable business model** — Paid tiers from day one
- **Your own domain** — `username.grove.place` is YOURS
- **Export everything** — No platform lock-in

## Messaging Themes

### Theme 1: "The Refuge You've Been Looking For"

Cohost users called it a "refuge." Grove is literally positioned as a "sanctuary." This language resonates.

**Sample copy:**
> "When Cohost closed, you lost your refuge. We're building another one."

> "A sanctuary for the writers who've been wandering since January."

> "The last meaningful refuge closed. A new one is growing."

### Theme 2: "We Learned From What Happened"

Cohost died because of funding. Grove has sustainable pricing from day one.

**Sample copy:**
> "Cohost taught us something important: refuges need roots. Grove is built to last — sustainable pricing, no single funder, designed for the long haul."

> "We saw what happened when a beloved space couldn't sustain itself. Grove is different: you pay for the service, we stay alive. Simple."

### Theme 3: "Your Words Deserve to Outlive Platforms"

Cohost's shutdown meant scrambling to archive content. Grove's Centennial addresses this directly.

**Sample copy:**
> "Platforms die. Your words shouldn't. Grove's Centennial means your blog stays online for 100 years — even if you stop paying, even if we're gone."

> "Remember scrambling to save your Cohost posts? Grove lets you export everything, anytime. And after a year, your site earns permanent preservation."

### Theme 4: "Weird and Wonderful, But Sustainable"

Cohost's vibe was "unashamedly weird." Grove has personality too — but also a business model.

**Sample copy:**
> "We believe in weird. We believe in wonderful. We also believe in paying our hosting bills. Grove is the chaotic queer energy you loved, built on foundations that won't crumble."

## Where to Find Cohost Refugees

### Platforms

**Pillowfort** — Many Cohost users landed here. Look for:
- Communities with "cohost" in the name
- Users with "ex-choster" in bios
- Posts tagged #cohost or #cohostrefugee

**Tumblr** — Some returned to Tumblr. Search for:
- #cohost tag
- Posts mourning Cohost
- "Where did everyone go" discussions

**Bluesky** — Queer community is strong here. Look for:
- Accounts that mention Cohost in posts
- LGBTQ+ starter packs (former Cohost users are in these)

**Mastodon** — Fediverse users. Search:
- #cohost hashtag
- Queer-focused instances

**Discord** — Communities formed around Cohost refugees. Harder to find but they exist.

### Specific Outreach

**Do:**
- Engage genuinely in discussions about missing Cohost
- Share Grove when relevant (not spam)
- Acknowledge the grief (people genuinely mourned Cohost)
- Be honest about being a new platform

**Don't:**
- Spam "come to Grove!" on every Cohost memorial post
- Pretend to be a community member if you weren't on Cohost
- Dismiss what made Cohost special
- Promise you'll never shut down (you can't guarantee that)

## Sample Posts

### For Bluesky/Twitter
```
Six months since Cohost closed.

If you're still looking for a place that feels like that — queer-friendly, no algorithms, long-form friendly, actually gives a shit about its community — I built one.

It's called Grove. It's a forest, not a factory.

grove.place 🌲
```

### For Tumblr
```
To everyone who's been wandering since Cohost closed:

I get it. Finding another place that felt like *that* seemed impossible.

I've been building something. It's called Grove. It's a blogging platform where:
- Your words aren't training data (we block AI crawlers)
- There's no algorithm deciding who sees what
- Reactions are private (no public metrics, no pile-ons)
- After a year, your blog earns 100-year preservation

It's queer-friendly. It's weird-friendly. It's built to last.

grove.place

(Reading is free. You only pay to write.)
```

### For Direct Outreach (DMs, Comments)
```
Hey, saw you mention missing Cohost. Totally understand — that place was special.

I've been building something that might scratch that itch: Grove (grove.place). It's a blogging platform that's queer-friendly, has no algorithms, and actually has a sustainable business model so it won't disappear overnight.

No pressure, just thought you might want to know it exists. 🌲
```

### For Pillowfort
```
Hi, new here (sort of) — I'm the person building Grove, a blogging platform.

I wasn't on Cohost, but I've heard so many people describe it as "the last meaningful refuge of the queer internet." That phrase hit me hard.

Grove is my attempt to build something like that — but sustainable. Queer-owned, no algorithms, no AI training on your words, and a feature called Centennial that keeps your blog online for 100 years.

If any of you are looking for a new home for your writing, the door's open.

grove.place
```

## Longer-Form Content Ideas

### Blog Post: "Learning From Cohost"
A thoughtful post about what made Cohost special, why it failed, and how Grove is built differently. Not exploitative — genuinely analytical and respectful.

**Outline:**
1. What Cohost got right (community, values, vibe)
2. What happened (funding, sustainability)
3. The diaspora (where people went, what was lost)
4. What Grove learned (sustainable pricing, Centennial, no single funder)
5. An invitation (not a pitch — an open door)

### Guest Post: Invite a Former Cohost User
Ask a former Cohost user to write about their experience — the loss, the wandering, and (if they try Grove) whether it fills any of that gap. Let them be honest.

## Timing Considerations

**6-month mark (July 2025):** Good time to post "6 months later" reflection content
**1-year mark (January 2026):** Anniversary content, "a year of wandering" theme
**When launching:** Mention Cohost specifically as context for why Grove exists

---

## Tone Guidelines

**Do:**
- Acknowledge the grief (Cohost closing was genuinely sad)
- Be humble (you're new, they had something special)
- Be honest about being a business (you charge money, that's why you'll survive)
- Celebrate what made Cohost good (don't just use them for marketing)

**Don't:**
- Be ghoulish ("Cohost is dead, come to us!")
- Overpromise ("We'll never shut down!")
- Dismiss concerns ("That won't happen to us")
- Pretend you're identical (Grove is different, own that)

---

## The Core Message

> "Cohost proved that queer people want their own spaces online — spaces with values, with community, with room to be weird. It also proved that those spaces need sustainable foundations.
>
> Grove is an attempt to build both: the refuge *and* the roots.
>
> The door is open. The forest is growing."

*This isn't about capturing a market. It's about offering shelter to people who lost theirs.*
