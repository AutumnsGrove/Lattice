# Grove at a Glance

**What is Grove?**
A blogging platform that gives you your own corner of the internet.

**How does it work?**
You get `yourname.grove.place` — a website that's yours. Write posts, share them, and own everything you create.

**What makes it different?**

- **Your words stay yours.** AI companies send bots to scrape websites and train their models on your writing. Grove blocks them. Your posts are for your readers, not for training data.

- **No algorithms.** No feed designed to keep you scrolling. No engagement metrics. Just people reading what they want to read.

- **No ads.** You're the customer, not the product.

- **Take your stuff and go.** Export everything anytime. Your content lives in standard formats, not locked in a walled garden.

**Who is it for?**
Writers who want a home on the internet without the surveillance, manipulation, and noise of social media. People who remember when the web felt personal.

**How much does it cost?**
Plans start at $8/month. No free tier with hidden catches — just straightforward pricing for a service that respects you.
