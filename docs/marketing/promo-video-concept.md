## Scene-by-Scene Storyboard

### Scene 1: Opening (0:00 - 0:05)
**Visual:** Soft morning light filtering through leaves. A single seedling emerges from rich soil.
**Text overlay:** *"In a noisy internet..."*
**Audio:** Gentle ambient nature sounds, soft wind

### Scene 2: The Problem (0:05 - 0:12)
**Visual:** Quick flash of chaotic feeds: notifications, algorithmic noise, endless scroll (shown abstractly, blurred/distorted)
**Text overlay:** *"...finding your voice can feel impossible."*
**Audio:** Brief, subtle discordant tone that fades

### Scene 3: Transition (0:12 - 0:15)
**Visual:** The chaos dissolves into leaves blowing away. Camera pulls back to reveal a peaceful grove.
**Text overlay:** None
**Audio:** Return to calm ambient sounds

### Scene 4: The Solution (0:15 - 0:25)
**Visual:** A beautiful, minimal blog interface materializes organically, like vines growing into shape. Show:
- A clean writing space
- A personal domain (e.g., "yourname.grove.place")
- Words appearing naturally on the page

**Text overlay:** *"Grove. A quiet corner of the internet."*
**Audio:** Soft, warm piano notes begin

### Scene 5: The Flow (0:25 - 0:35)
**Visual:** Simple animated sequence showing:
1. A person signing up (abstract/silhouette)
2. Choosing their space/domain
3. Their first post going live
4. A small community of readers discovering it

**Text overlay:**
- "Sign up" → "Choose your space" → "Start growing"

**Audio:** Piano continues, slightly more hopeful

### Scene 6: Closing (0:35 - 0:45)
**Visual:** Pull back to show multiple groves connected by gentle paths, a network of individual spaces. Zoom settles on the Grove logo (the layered leaf/tree mark).

**Text overlay:**
- "Grove"
- *"a place to Be"*
- "grove.place"

**Audio:** Piano resolves to a gentle close

## Key Messaging Points

1. **Peace over chaos**: Grove is an escape from algorithmic feeds
2. **Your space, your rules**: Personal domain, no ads, no tracking
3. **Simple to start**: Three steps to your own corner of the internet
4. **Community without noise**: Connected but not overwhelming

## Visual Style Notes

### Do
- Use organic, natural transitions (leaves, growth, flowing water)
- Keep motion slow and deliberate
- Use the Grove color palette consistently
- Show the product UI cleanly but briefly
- Emphasize negative space and breathing room

### Don't
- Fast cuts or jarring transitions
- Bright, harsh colors
- Busy or cluttered frames
- Corporate/sterile aesthetics
- Faces (keep it abstract and universal)

---

## Text/Typography

- Headlines: Serif font (Georgia/Cambria style)
- Keep text minimal: let visuals tell the story
- Fade in/out gently, never snap

---

## Audio Direction

**Option A: Nature Ambient**
- Wind through leaves
- Distant birdsong
- Soft rain (optional)
- No music, just atmosphere

**Option B: Minimal Piano**
- 4-5 gentle notes
- Major key, warm tone
- Slow tempo
- Blended with subtle nature sounds

**Option C: Hybrid**
- Start with pure nature sounds
- Introduce soft piano at Scene 4
- Blend both through the end

## Prompt for AI Video Generation

Use this as a starting prompt for AI video tools:

> Create a 45-second promotional video for a blogging platform called "Grove." The style should be calm, organic, and nature-inspired, like a peaceful garden at dawn.
>
> Open with morning light through leaves and a seedling growing. Briefly show abstract chaotic internet imagery (blurred, discordant) before it dissolves into falling leaves.
>
> Transition to a clean, minimal blog interface growing organically like vines. Show a simple three-step flow: sign up, choose a domain, start writing.
>
> End with multiple connected groves (blogs) forming a gentle network, zooming to a leaf/tree logo with the text "Grove: a place to Be. grove.place"
>
> Color palette: forest green (#16a34a), cream (#fefdfb), warm brown. Music: soft ambient piano with nature sounds. Pace: slow, deliberate, calming.

## Notes

This concept is designed to be generated with AI video tools like:
- Runway Gen-3
- Pika Labs
- Kling
- Sora (when available)

The prompt can be broken into scene-by-scene generations and stitched together, or fed as a complete concept depending on the tool's capabilities.
