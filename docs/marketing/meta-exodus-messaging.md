# Meta Exodus Messaging

*Reaching LGBTQ+ users fleeing Instagram and Facebook after January 2025 policy changes*

---

## Context

**What happened:** On January 7, 2025, Meta announced major policy changes:
- Suspended fact-checking programs
- Reduced content moderation
- Updated hate speech policies to **allow calling transgender identity a "mental illness"**
- Removed "gender identity" from protected characteristics

**The impact:**
- 92% of LGBTQ+ respondents feel less protected
- 77% feel less safe expressing themselves
- Mass exodus to alternative platforms
- GLAAD launched "Make Meta Safe" campaign

**Where they're going:** Bluesky (primary), but many don't know where to go for *long-form* content. Instagram was visual/short-form; they need something new for writing.

**The opportunity:** Writers and creators who used Instagram/Facebook for updates and connection now need a *home base* that isn't controlled by Zuckerberg.

## Why Grove Resonates

| What Meta Did | What Grove Does |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Allowed anti-trans hate speech | Explicitly queer-friendly, transphobia banned |
| Algorithmic feed manipulation | Chronological, no algorithm |
| Tracks 6,000+ signals per user | No tracking, no surveillance |
| AI training on your content | Blocks AI crawlers |
| Corporate values shift with politics | Values-first, indie-owned |
| Platform controls your reach | You own your domain, your content |

**The pitch:** "Meta decided your identity is up for debate. Grove decided you deserve a home."

---

## Messaging Themes

### Theme 1: "Your Identity Isn't a Policy Decision"

Meta made LGBTQ+ safety a political calculation. Grove doesn't negotiate on values.

**Sample copy:**
> "Meta decided calling trans people 'mentally ill' is acceptable speech. We decided it isn't. Grove is built on values that don't change with elections."

> "When a platform makes your identity a policy debate, it's time to own your own space."

> "Some platforms negotiate on whether you're human. We don't."

### Theme 2: "Own Your Platform, Own Your Voice"

Instagram and Facebook can change policies overnight. Your own blog can't be taken from you.

**Sample copy:**
> "Mark Zuckerberg can change his policies. He can't change your domain. Grove gives you yourname.grove.place — yours to keep."

> "Building on Instagram is building on rented land. Build on Grove, and the land is yours."

> "Tired of platforms that can pull the rug out? Grove lets you export everything, anytime. Your words, your ownership."

### Theme 3: "A Refuge, Not a Platform"

Meta is optimized for engagement. Grove is optimized for peace.

**Sample copy:**
> "Instagram wants your attention. Grove wants you to have a home. Different goals."

> "No algorithm deciding who sees your posts. No engagement metrics. No dopamine manipulation. Just your words, your readers."

> "Grove is what Instagram would be if it were built by someone who gives a shit about queer people."

### Theme 4: "The Writing Platform for Visual Creators"

Many Instagram users are visual artists/creators who also write. Grove supports images AND long-form.

**Sample copy:**
> "Instagram was never for writing. Grove is. But we also love your photos — upload images, build galleries, make it beautiful."

> "For creators who outgrew captions. Grove gives you space to actually *say* things."

## Sample Posts

### For Bluesky
```
If you left Instagram because Meta decided transphobia is fine now:

Hi. I built a place for you.

Grove is a blogging platform where:
- Your identity isn't a policy debate
- There's no algorithm
- Your words aren't AI training data
- You own your content forever

Queer-built. Queer-friendly. No Zuckerberg.

grove.place 🌲
```

### For General Social
```
January 2025: Meta decides calling trans people "mentally ill" is acceptable.

Also January 2025: I was building a platform where that would never be acceptable.

Grove is queer-owned, values-first, and designed for writers who are tired of building on platforms that can betray them overnight.

Your domain. Your content. Your home.

grove.place
```

### Responding to "I'm Leaving Instagram" Posts
```
Hey, saw you're leaving Instagram (totally get it).

If you're looking for a place to write — not just post, but actually *write* — I built Grove. It's a blogging platform that's queer-friendly, blocks AI crawlers, and gives you yourname.grove.place.

No algorithms, no Zuckerberg. Just your words and your readers.

grove.place 🌲
```

### For Visual Creators/Artists
```
For artists and creators who used Instagram because there was nowhere else:

Grove isn't Instagram. But it's yours.

- Upload images, build galleries
- Write long-form (not just captions!)
- Beautiful themes with nature aesthetics
- Your own domain (yourname.grove.place)
- No algorithm suppressing your reach

Built for the exodus. Built to last.

grove.place
```

## Timing Considerations

**January 2026 (1-year anniversary):** "One year since Meta decided transphobia was acceptable. Here's what we built instead."

**When Meta makes news:** Be ready to post when Meta does something bad (they will). Have content prepared.

**Pride Month:** Emphasize the queer-owned, queer-safe angle. Contrast with Meta's rainbow-washing while allowing hate speech.

## Talking Points for Common Questions

### "But all my followers are on Instagram"

> "Instagram owns your followers. On Grove, you own your blog. Build your email list, share your RSS feed, post links on whatever social platform you want. Your Grove blog is the *home base*, not another platform hoping you never leave."

### "Can't I just use Linktree/Carrd?"

> "Those are landing pages, not homes. Grove gives you a full blog — posts, pages, images, your own domain, RSS feed, the works. It's not a link aggregator; it's your own website."

### "Why pay when Instagram is free?"

> "Instagram is 'free' because you're the product. Your data, your attention, your engagement — that's what you're paying with. Grove costs $8/month because you're the *customer*, not the product. No ads, no tracking, no selling your data."

### "Is Grove going to change its policies too?"

> "Grove is indie-owned, queer-owned, and values-first. There's no board to appease, no shareholders demanding growth at any cost. The policies exist because I believe in them, not because they're good for business."
