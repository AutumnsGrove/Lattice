## Thread

**1/**
I quit my job last week and launched a blogging platform I built in a month.

Why? Because I'm tired of my friends being trapped in dopamine slot machines designed to exploit neurodivergent minds.

Grove gives you `yourname.grove.place`. Your own corner of the internet.

It blocks AI crawlers at the gate. Your words are not training data.

You can export everything anytime. No lock-in.

**3/**
No algorithms. No ads. No engagement metrics.

No viral mechanics rewarding the loudest voice.

Just people, sharing what matters to them.

**4/**
Built by a neurodivergent queer person, for people who've left social media because it's literally designed to manipulate us.

I'm not the prime target for social platforms. I'm the escape route.

**5/**
Launching this week to 70 early supporters.

This is the most alive I've felt in years.

Let's build something better.
