# Grove Advertising & Marketing Strategy

*Created: January 2026*

---

## Overview

This document outlines how Grove markets itself to the world. No ads *on* the platform—this is about getting the word out to people who'd love what we're building.

---

## Core Principle

**Word of mouth is the marketing.** Grove is built on genuine value, not growth hacks. The best marketing is making something so good people tell their friends.

That said, we still need to be discoverable. Here's the strategy.

---

## Marketing Channels

### 1. Organic / Word of Mouth (Primary)
- **How:** Build something people genuinely want to share
- **Where:** Conversations, coffee shops, Discord servers, group chats
- **Cost:** $0
- **Effectiveness:** Highest. Real recommendations beat ads.

### 2. Business Cards (Physical)
- **How:** Hand them out at cafés, bookstores, meetups, conventions
- **Where:** Barnes & Noble (where the idea took root), local coffee shops, tech meetups
- **Spec:** See `business-card-spec.md`
- **Cost:** ~$50-100 for 500 cards
- **Why it works:** Personal touch. People keep interesting cards.

### 3. Hacker News / Indie Hacker Communities
- **How:** Show HN post, genuine engagement in comments
- **Where:** Hacker News, Indie Hackers, r/SideProject
- **Spec:** See `hacker-news-post.md`
- **Cost:** $0
- **Why it works:** Technical audience, values-aligned, appreciates good engineering

### 4. Social Media (Bluesky, Mastodon, Twitter/X)
- **How:** Thread-style storytelling, building in public updates
- **Where:** Bluesky (primary), Mastodon, Twitter/X (limited)
- **Spec:** See `twitter-thread.md`
- **Cost:** $0
- **Why it works:** Queer and indie tech communities are strong on Bluesky

### 5. Short-Form Video (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Reels)
- **How:** Demo videos, "I built this" content, Shade protection showcase
- **Where:** TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels
- **Spec:** See `video-concept-shade-demo.md`
- **Cost:** $0 (time investment)
- **Why it works:** Visual proof of the product, viral potential

### 6. Email List
- **How:** Waitlist updates, launch announcements, occasional value-add content
- **Where:** Buttondown or similar
- **Spec:** See `grove-launch-email-v*.md` in `docs/internal/`
- **Cost:** Free tier for <500 subscribers
- **Why it works:** Direct line to interested people, no algorithm

### 7. Content Marketing
- **How:** Blog posts about privacy, indie web, AI protection
- **Where:** Grove's own blog (meta!), cross-posted to dev.to, Medium
- **Topics:** "Why I built Grove", "How we block AI crawlers", "The indie web is coming back"
- **Cost:** $0
- **Why it works:** SEO, establishes expertise, attracts values-aligned users

---

## Channel NOT Using

### Paid Advertising
- **Why not:** Expensive, feels hypocritical (we're anti-surveillance), attracts wrong audience
- **Exception:** Might experiment with small Bluesky/Mastodon sponsorships if ROI is clear

### Influencer Marketing
- **Why not:** Inauthentic, expensive, temporary spike vs. steady growth
- **Exception:** Organic mentions from people who genuinely use Grove = great

### SEO Gaming
- **Why not:** Doesn't align with values, Google's AI summaries make it less effective anyway
- **What we do instead:** Write genuinely useful content, let it rank naturally

---

## Target Audiences (Prioritized)

### Tier 1: Values-Aligned Writers
- **Who:** People explicitly looking for privacy-respecting, ad-free blogging
- **Where:** Indie web communities, privacy subreddits, Mastodon
- **Message:** "Your words are yours. No AI training. No ads. No algorithms."

### Tier 2: Queer/Marginalized Creators
- **Who:** People who need safe digital spaces, especially as physical spaces feel less safe
- **Where:** Queer Discord servers, trans Twitter/Bluesky, LGBTQ+ tech communities
- **Message:** "A safe space online. Built by community, for community."

### Tier 3: Neurodivergent Folks
- **Who:** People overwhelmed by feature-bloated platforms
- **Where:** ADHD/autism communities, productivity communities
- **Message:** "Simple by design. Write. Publish. That's it."

### Tier 4: Technical Early Adopters
- **Who:** Developers, indie hackers, people who appreciate good engineering
- **Where:** Hacker News, dev.to, tech Twitter
- **Message:** "Built on Cloudflare. Privacy-first architecture. Open about how it works."

### Tier 5: General Hobbyist Bloggers
- **Who:** People who just want a simple blog
- **Where:** Everywhere (hardest to target)
- **Message:** "A blog that's yours. Starts at $8/month."

## Messaging Framework

### The One-Liner
> Grove is a blogging platform where your words stay yours.

### The Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
> Grove gives you your own website at yourname.grove.place. No ads, no algorithms, no AI training on your content. We block the bots that scrape other platforms. Your writing is for your readers, not training data. Plans start at $8/month, and reading is always free.

### The Story (2 minutes)
> Remember when the internet felt personal? Before algorithms decided what you see, before every platform wanted to own your content, before AI companies started scraping everything to train models?
>
> I built Grove because I think we can have that again. Your own space. Your own words. No surveillance, no manipulation, no competing for engagement. Just writing for the people who want to read it.
>
> It's solarpunk-aligned: decentralized, community-focused, sustainable. A quiet corner of the web where things can grow.

### Key Phrases
- "Your words are yours"
- "A place to Be"
- "No ads. No algorithms. No AI training."
- "A quiet corner of the internet"
- "Built for humans, not engagement"
