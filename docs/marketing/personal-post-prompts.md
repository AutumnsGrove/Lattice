# Personal Blog Post: Writing Prompts

> **Purpose**: Prompts and starting points for YOUR "Why Grove Exists" post
> **Where it lives**: On your own Grove blog — the canonical source all social points back to
> **Tone**: This is YOUR voice. Raw, personal, real. Not marketing copy.

---

## The Goal

This post becomes the anchor. When someone asks "what is Grove?", you send them here. When you post on social, you're excerpting *this*. It's the full story, told once, told well, on your own platform.

---

## Structure Suggestion

Not prescriptive — just one way to organize the journey:

1. **The Before** — What you had, what it meant
2. **The Loss** — What happened, what it felt like
3. **The Numbness** — The basement, the fog, the texture draining
4. **The Spark** — What made you start building
5. **The Building** — What it felt like to create this
6. **The Why** — What Grove is for, who it's for
7. **The Invitation** — Welcome to the grove

## Prompts to Get You Started

### On the Sanctuary You Lost

- What did your backyard actually feel like? Not just what was there — what did it feel like to BE there?
- The hammock specifically — when did you stop using it? What was that moment like?
- The robins. What was your morning ritual? What did it feel like when that stopped?
- What do you mean by "texture"? When did you first notice it was gone?

### On the Transition

- What was the day you moved like?
- What's the basement actually like? (No windows — what does that DO to you?)
- How did days blur together? What did "numb" feel like specifically?
- The hormones piece — how much do you want to share? (This is powerful but personal. Your call.)

### On Starting to Build

- What was the moment you started? Was it a decision or did it just happen?
- Did you know what you were making at first?
- When did you realize you were rebuilding what you'd lost?
- The names (Songbird, Wander, Terrarium) — when did you realize they were all connected to your story?

### On the Building Process

- What did it feel like to be in hyperfocus for 57 days?
- The crying in the parking lot moment — what triggered it? What did that feel like?
- When did you know this was real? When did it stop being a project and become a mission?
- "The art that must exist" — what does that mean to you?

### On What Grove Actually Is

- If someone has never heard of Grove, what do you want them to feel first?
- What's the one thing you wish every platform did that none of them do?
- The "dopamine slot machine" metaphor — where does your anger at that come from?
- What does "queer-friendly infrastructure" mean to you personally?

### On Who It's For

- Who do you picture when you imagine someone signing up?
- What do they look like? What's their life like? What are they tired of?
- "A grove for people who lost their groves" — what other kinds of groves have people lost?
- What would you tell someone who feels like the internet has no place for them?

### On the Future

- What does success look like? Not metrics — what does it FEEL like?
- The Centennial status (100 years) — why does that matter to you?
- If Grove becomes what you hope, what does the internet look like in 10 years?
- What scares you about this? What excites you most?

## Lines You've Already Written (Steal from Yourself)

From **Why I Built the Grove**:
> "Grove came into existence as my life was truly sparking back to life. The timing wasn't coincidental. The two are tangled together now."

> "The art demands to exist."

> "Fifty days. I built all of this in fifty days, teaching myself everything as I went. It's the first thing I've ever made that I'm genuinely, deeply proud of."

From **the Manifesto**:
> "I think that's disgusting."

> "Grove is everything that isn't."

> "Grove is not trying to be everything. It's trying to be somewhere."

From **the Vision**:
> "Encouragement without performance. Connection without competition."

> "A forest of voices. A place to be."

## Things to Consider Including

- [ ] The actual timeline (November 22 → now)
- [ ] The commit count (1,500+) and what that represents
- [ ] The names and what they mean (Songbird = robins, Wander = freedom, etc.)
- [ ] The "blocking ClaudeBot while building with Claude" irony
- [ ] What you want people to DO after reading (sign up? just know this exists?)

---

## Things to Maybe Leave Out (Or Save for Later)

- Technical details (save for separate posts)
- Feature lists (the product pages do this)
- Pricing specifics (link to that instead)
- Anything that feels like selling (this is a story, not a pitch)

---

## The Opening Line

The first line matters. Some possibilities to riff on:

- "I used to have a backyard."
- "Let me tell you about a hammock."
- "I lost my grove. So I built one."
- "Fifty-seven days ago, I didn't know how to code a website."
- "This is not a startup story. This is a survival story."

Or something completely different. The right opening will feel like exhaling.

---

## The Closing

How do you want people to feel when they finish reading?

- Seen? ("If this resonates, you're not alone")
- Invited? ("Come plant something")
- Hopeful? ("The internet can be better")
- Connected? ("Welcome to the grove")

The last line should land like the manifesto's "welcome to the Grove" — an open door, not a call-to-action button.

---

## When You're Stuck

- Go for a walk (an actual walk, in actual trees if possible)
- Read your own manifesto page out loud
- Remember: you've already told this story a hundred times in conversations
- This is just writing down what you already know
- It doesn't have to be perfect. It has to be true.

---

*Write like you're talking to someone at 2am who just said "so what IS Grove?" and you have all night.*
