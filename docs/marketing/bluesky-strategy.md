# Bluesky Launch Strategy

*How to leverage Bluesky's queer community for Grove's launch*

---

## Why Bluesky Matters

Bluesky is **the** platform for reaching queer creators right now:

- **15M+ users**, growing rapidly
- **1,700+ LGBTQ+ starter packs** — community is highly organized
- Primary destination for Twitter/X refugees
- Queer users report feeling "liberated" and "safer"
- Early Twitter vibes — chaotic, fun, community-driven

**The opportunity:** Grove's target audience is already concentrated here, actively looking for better alternatives, and organized into discoverable communities.

---

## What Are Starter Packs?

Starter packs are curated lists of accounts users can follow all at once. They solve the "empty feed" problem and help communities find each other.

**Examples of LGBTQ+ starter packs:**
- 69+ Gay starter packs
- 135+ LGBTQIA+ general packs
- 19+ LGBTQ+ Artists packs
- 16+ LGBTQ+ Studies/academics packs
- 10+ Queer Artists packs
- Specialized: writers, game devs, musicians, photographers

**How to find them:** [blueskystarterpack.com/lgbtq](https://blueskystarterpack.com/lgbtq)

## Strategy: Three Phases

### Phase 1: Get INTO Existing Packs (Pre-Launch)

**Goal:** Get @groveplace (or your personal account) added to relevant starter packs before launch.

**Target packs to join:**
- Queer tech/indie web packs
- LGBTQ+ writers/bloggers packs
- Indie developers packs
- Solarpunk/ethical tech packs

**How to get added:**
1. Follow the pack creator
2. Engage genuinely with their content
3. Post about what you're building (building in public)
4. DM asking if they'd consider adding you (be genuine, not spammy)

**Your pitch:**
> "Hey! I'm building Grove, a queer-friendly blogging platform. Would love to be considered for your [pack name] if you think it fits!"

---

### Phase 2: Create Grove's Starter Pack (Launch Week)

**Goal:** Create a "Grove Writers" starter pack featuring your early users.

**Pack name options:**
- "Writers in the Grove"
- "Grove Bloggers"
- "The Grove — Queer Writers"
- "Wanderers of the Grove"

**Who to include:**
- Your 70 waitlist members (those on Bluesky)
- Early adopters who launch their blogs
- Yourself / Grove official account

**Benefits:**
- Makes early users feel special (they're in THE pack)
- Creates instant community visibility
- Gives new users a reason to join Grove (be part of the pack)
- Helps Grove users find each other

**How to create:**
1. Go to your Bluesky profile
2. Click "Starter Packs" tab
3. Click "Create Starter Pack"
4. Add accounts, write description, publish

**Pack description template:**
```
Writers who've planted their blogs in the Grove 🌲

Grove is a queer-friendly blogging platform where your words stay yours. No algorithms, no AI training, no ads.

Find your people. Read their stories. Maybe plant your own.

grove.place
```

---

### Phase 3: Community Seeding (Post-Launch)

**Goal:** Encourage Grove users to create their own niche starter packs.

**Ideas for user-created packs:**
- "Queer Poets in the Grove"
- "Grove Game Devs"
- "Neurodivergent Writers — Grove Edition"
- "Trans Writers in the Grove"
- "Grove Horror Writers"

**How to encourage this:**
- Feature user-created packs in Meadow
- Highlight pack creators on the Grove blog
- Create a guide: "How to Make a Grove Starter Pack on Bluesky"

---

## Content Strategy for Bluesky

### What to Post

**Building in Public (Pre-Launch):**
- Development milestones ("Just hit 3,000 tests passing!")
- Design decisions ("Here's why Grove has private reactions")
- Personal story moments ("Built this because I lost my hammock...")
- Screenshots of the UI (nature aesthetic stands out)

**Launch Content:**
- Thread announcing launch (see `twitter-thread.md`)
- Link to starter pack
- Individual user blog highlights
- "Welcome to the Grove" posts

**Ongoing:**
- Feature Grove blogs (with permission)
- Share quotes from user posts
- Seasonal theme announcements
- Behind-the-scenes development

### Voice on Bluesky

**Do:**
- Be personal, not corporate
- Use "I" not "we" (you're a solo dev)
- Show vulnerability (the real story)
- Engage with replies genuinely
- Boost queer creators liberally
- Use the 🌲 emoji as signature

**Don't:**
- Sound like marketing
- Engagement bait ("What do YOU think?")
- Post and ghost — stick around to chat
- Argue with bad-faith critics
- Be defensive about being small

### Posting Cadence

**Launch week:** Daily posts
**Ongoing:** 3-4x per week
**Best times:** US morning/early afternoon (11am-2pm ET)

---

## Specific Outreach Targets

### Accounts to Follow & Engage With

**Queer tech/indie web:**
- Look for accounts posting about IndieWeb, personal websites, ethical tech
- Solarpunk community accounts
- Anti-surveillance/privacy advocates

**Writers & bloggers:**
- Queer authors with active Bluesky presence
- Newsletter writers (especially Substack refugees)
- Poets, essayists, fiction writers

**Community builders:**
- People who've created popular LGBTQ+ starter packs
- Admins of queer Discord servers
- Folks who post "welcome to Bluesky" threads

### Hashtags to Use & Follow

Bluesky doesn't emphasize hashtags like Twitter, but these help discoverability:
- #QueerWriters

---

## Metrics to Track

**What matters:**
- Click-throughs to grove.place
- Signups from Bluesky referrals
- Starter pack follows
- Genuine conversations started

**What doesn't matter:**
- Follower count
- Like counts
- "Engagement rate"

**How to track:**
- UTM parameters on links (`grove.place?ref=bluesky`)
- Ask in signup form: "How did you hear about Grove?"

---

## Emergency Playbook

### If a post goes viral:
1. Don't panic
2. Pin the most important link (grove.place)
3. Reply to genuine questions
4. Ignore trolls completely
5. It's okay to step away if overwhelmed

### If you get criticism:
1. **Valid criticism:** Thank them, consider it, maybe respond with your thinking
2. **Bad-faith attacks:** Don't engage, block if needed
3. **"Why should I pay for a blog?":** Have your answer ready (see competitor talking points)

### If Bluesky has drama:
Bluesky has had leadership issues (the "WAFFLES" incident). If something happens:
- Don't pile on
- Focus on your own values
- Maybe post: "This is why owning your own space matters"

## Sample Posts

### Launch Announcement
```
I quit my job and built a blogging platform for people who are tired of being trapped in dopamine slot machines.

Grove gives you yourname.grove.place. Your words, your space.

- Blocks AI crawlers (your writing isn't training data)
- No algorithms
- Private reactions (no public metrics)
- Queer-friendly by design

Launching today. 🌲

grove.place
```

### Starter Pack Announcement
```
Made a starter pack for writers who've planted their blogs in the Grove 🌲

These are the first Wanderers — queer writers, poets, essayists finding their corner of the internet.

Follow them all, read their stories, maybe plant your own.

[starter pack link]
```

### Personal Reflection
```
A year ago I had a hammock between two trees and robins I knew by song.

Then I lost everything and moved into a basement.

I built Grove because I needed to build something that felt alive again.

Today it's real. People are writing. The forest is growing.

🌲
```

### Responding to "Why pay for a blog?"
```
Fair question!

You're paying for:
- No ads (you're the customer, not the product)
- AI crawler blocking (your words aren't training data)
- 100-year preservation (Centennial — your blog outlives you)
- Someone who actually gives a shit

$8/month. Less than a fancy coffee.

But also: reading is free. You only pay to write.
```

*Remember: Bluesky is where your people already are. You're not trying to build an audience from scratch — you're inviting them home.*
