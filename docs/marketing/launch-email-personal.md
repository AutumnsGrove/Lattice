**Subject**: Grove is opening (and I quit my job for this)

---

Hey friends,

I'm not gonna bury the lede: I quit my job last week. And I'm launching Grove in a few days.

For the past month, I've been building something I actually believe in. Something that doesn't spy on you, doesn't train AI on your words, doesn't make you compete for attention. A place where you can just... write.

Grove is a blogging platform that gives you your own corner of the internet: **username.grove.place**

Here's what makes it different:

- **Shade Protection**: AI crawlers are blocked at the gate. Your words are not training data. (Yes, I really blocked ClaudeBot. Even from my own platform. Principles matter.)
- **Your domain, your rules**: Full data export anytime. Your content lives in markdown, not a walled garden.
- **No algorithms, no ads, no bullshit**: Just a clean space to write.
- **Built for humans**: Neurodivergent-friendly, queer-friendly, actually accessible.

The first 70 of you signed up for the waitlist. I'm emailing you first because you're either my friends or people who've been cheering this on since the beginning.

**Launch pricing:**
- **Seedling**: $8/month (50 posts, perfect for starting out)
- **Sapling**: $12/month (250 posts, most popular)
- Custom domains and more coming soon.

Sign-ups open in a few days. If you're in, you're in early. If you're not sure, keep using the RSS feeds — they work from day one.

This is the most alive I've felt in years. Let's build something that actually matters.
