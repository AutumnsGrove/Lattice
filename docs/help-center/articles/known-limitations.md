# Known Limitations

Grove is intentionally focused. Some things we don't do, not because we couldn't, but because they'd compromise what Grove is trying to be.

Here's what you won't find, and why.

## No e-commerce

Grove doesn't support:
- Payment processing
- Product listings
- Shopping carts
- Digital downloads for sale

**Why:** E-commerce adds massive complexity: tax handling, fraud prevention, disputes, inventory management. It would pull focus from writing and turn Grove into something it's not.

**Alternative:** If you need to sell things, use a dedicated platform (Gumroad, Shopify, Ko-fi) and link to it from your Grove blog.

## No real-time analytics

Your analytics dashboard shows data with a deliberate delay. You won't see live visitor counts or watch numbers tick up in real-time.

**Why:** Real-time analytics create compulsive checking behavior. Refresh, refresh, refresh. Did anyone read my post yet? It's anxiety-inducing and doesn't help you write better.

**What you get instead:** Aggregated insights updated periodically. Enough to understand what resonates, not enough to obsess over.

## No visible vote counts

In Meadow, votes exist but the counts are hidden. You can vote on posts, but you'll never see "142 upvotes" next to anything.

**Why:** Visible metrics gamify writing. People optimize for numbers instead of meaning. Hidden votes let you appreciate content without comparing it to everything else.

## No plugin system

You can't install third-party plugins or extensions. What Grove offers is what Grove offers.

**Why:** Plugins create security vulnerabilities, support nightmares, and inconsistent experiences. They also fragment the community. Suddenly support requests become "I installed this plugin and now..."

**What you get instead:** A curated, consistent experience. Features Grove adds work for everyone, reliably.

## No custom code injection

You can't add arbitrary JavaScript, custom CSS, or HTML snippets to your blog.

**Why:** Custom code breaks things in unpredictable ways, creates accessibility issues, and opens security holes. It also means Grove can't guarantee your blog will render correctly.

**What you get instead:** Meaningful customization through themes, fonts, colors, and layout options that are guaranteed to work.

## No SEO tools

Grove doesn't include:
- SEO score checkers
- Keyword density analyzers
- Meta tag optimizers
- Schema markup editors

**Why:** SEO tools encourage writing for algorithms instead of humans. They add cognitive overhead and rarely improve actual writing quality.

**What you get instead:** Grove handles technical SEO basics automatically: proper HTML structure, fast loading, mobile responsiveness. You focus on writing things people want to read.

## No scheduling (yet)

You can't schedule posts to publish at a future date and time.

**Why:** This is actually on the roadmap. It's a limitation, not a philosophical choice. We just haven't built it yet.

**Workaround:** Save as draft and manually publish when ready.

## No multi-author blogs

Grove is designed for individual bloggers. You can't add team members or collaborators to a single blog.

**Why:** Multi-author support adds complexity around permissions, attribution, and workflows. Grove is for personal expression, not publications.

**Alternative:** Each person can have their own Grove blog and cross-link to each other.

## Plan-based feature limits

Some features are restricted by subscription tier:

| Feature | Seedling | Sapling | Oak | Evergreen |
|---------|:--------:|:-------:|:---:|:---------:|
| Post limit | 50 | 250 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Storage | 1 GB | 5 GB | 20 GB | 100 GB |
| Custom domain | — | — | BYOD | Full service |
| @grove.place email | — | Forward | Full | Full |
| Theme options | Basic | Standard | Full | Full + custom |

**Why:** Running a platform costs money. Tiered pricing lets Grove exist without ads, data mining, or venture capital pressure.

See [Choosing Your Plan](/knowledge/help/choosing-your-plan) for details on what each tier includes.

## What if I need something that's limited?

If Grove's limitations don't work for you, that's okay. This platform isn't trying to be everything for everyone.

Some alternatives depending on your needs:
- **Need e-commerce?** Shopify, Squarespace, WooCommerce
- **Need teams?** Ghost, WordPress, Notion
- **Need custom code?** Self-hosted solutions
- **Need real-time analytics?** Most other platforms

No hard feelings. Use the tool that fits.

## Limitations vs. bugs

If something isn't working as expected, that might be a bug rather than a limitation. [Contact support](/knowledge/help/contact-support) and we'll figure out which it is.

*Constraints can be freeing. When you're not distracted by infinite options, you can focus on what matters: writing.*
