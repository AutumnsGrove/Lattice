# Drafts and Scheduling

Grove saves your work as you write. Here's how drafts work and what to expect.

## Auto-save while you write

The editor saves to your browser every few seconds. You don't need to do anything—it just happens.

If you accidentally close the tab, refresh the page, or your browser crashes, your work isn't lost. When you come back, Grove will ask if you want to restore your draft.

This local save is a safety net, not a substitute for the **Save** button. To actually store your post on Grove's servers, you still need to save it.

## Draft vs. Published

Every post has two states:

**Draft** — Saved to your account, but not visible to readers. Only you can see it. Take your time, edit it, come back to it later.

**Published** — Live on your blog. Anyone visiting your site can read it.

You can switch between these anytime:
- Publishing a draft makes it live
- Unpublishing a post returns it to draft status

Nothing is permanent. Changed your mind after publishing? Unpublish it. Ready to share that draft you've been sitting on? Publish it.

## Saving a draft

While editing:

1. Write your post
2. Click **Save** (or use the keyboard shortcut)
3. Your post is saved as a draft

The post now exists on Grove's servers. You can close the browser, switch devices, and come back later. Your draft will be waiting in **Posts → Drafts**.

## Restoring from auto-save

If the editor detects unsaved changes in your browser, you'll see a prompt:

> "You have unsaved changes from [time]. Restore?"

Click **Restore** to bring back your work, or **Discard** if you don't need it.

This happens when:
- You closed the tab without saving
- Your browser crashed
- You lost internet connection mid-edit

The auto-save stores your content locally—it's not synced across devices. If you started writing on your laptop but switch to your phone, you'll need to have saved to Grove first.

## Publishing your post

When you're ready to go live:

1. Click **Publish** instead of Save
2. Your post is immediately visible on your blog

Published posts:
- Appear on your blog's homepage
- Show up in your RSS feed
- Can appear in Meadow (if you've enabled sharing)

## Scheduling posts

Grove doesn't currently support scheduling posts for future publication. Posts go live when you click **Publish**.

If you want to prepare posts ahead of time:
- Write and save them as drafts
- Publish manually when you're ready

This is something we may add in the future, but for now, publishing is manual.

## Finding your drafts

All your drafts live in one place:

1. Go to **Posts** in your admin panel
2. Click the **Drafts** tab

You'll see everything you've saved but not published. Click any draft to continue editing.

## Tips for working with drafts

**Save often.** Auto-save catches accidents, but the Save button is what gets your work onto Grove's servers.

**Use drafts for ideas.** Start a post with just a title and a few notes. Come back when you're ready to write.

**Don't worry about perfection.** Drafts are private. Nobody sees them until you publish.

*Write when inspiration hits, save it, publish when it's ready. No pressure.*
