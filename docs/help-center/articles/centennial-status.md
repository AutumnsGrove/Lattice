# Centennial Status

Some trees outlive the people who planted them. Your grove can too.

Centennial is Grove's promise that your words can have real longevity. After 12 cumulative months on Sapling tier or above, your grove earns Centennial status. Your site stays online for 100 years from the day you planted it—even if you stop paying, even after you're gone.

## How it works

### Earning Centennial

You don't apply for Centennial. You don't unlock it through a special action. It happens automatically:

- **Yearly subscription (Sapling+):** After your first year completes, you're Centennial
- **Monthly subscription (Sapling+):** After 12 payments, you're in
- **Mixed path:** Only months on Sapling, Oak, or Evergreen count. Six months on Sapling, three months on Seedling (doesn't count), then six more on Oak? That's 12 qualifying months.

The counter only moves forward. Time on Seedling or Free doesn't add months, but it doesn't reset your progress either.

### What qualifies

| Plan | Centennial Eligible? |
|------|:----:|
| Free | No |
| Seedling ($8) | No |
| Sapling ($12) | Yes |
| Oak ($25) | Yes |
| Evergreen ($35) | Yes |

Sapling is where people start investing seriously. That's the threshold.

### The 100-year clock

The preservation period starts from your signup date—when you first created your Grove account—not when you earned Centennial. If you planted your grove in 2026, it's preserved until 2126.

Earning Centennial retroactively protects everything from day one.

## What Centennial means

Once earned, your grove has:

- **100-year domain reservation** — `yourname.grove.place` is yours for a century
- **Content preservation** — Your published posts stay publicly accessible
- **Working RSS feed** — Wanderers can still receive your content
- **Reactivation anytime** — Resume your subscription and pick up where you left off

### If you stop paying

Your site becomes a **read-only archive**:

- All your published posts remain online
- Visitors can still read everything
- RSS still works
- You can't edit, delete, or publish new posts
- A subtle indicator shows the site is preserved (not abandoned)

Think of it like finding a book on a library shelf years after it was written. It's still there. People can still read it. You just can't add new chapters unless you come back.

## Why this promise is real

Promising 100 years sounds bold. Here's why Grove can actually keep it.

### The math works

Grove runs on Cloudflare infrastructure. Hosting costs stay under 1% of revenue even at scale. Most platforms spend 30-50% on servers. Grove's architecture means almost every dollar can go toward sustainability.

### The Reserve

Once Grove reaches stability, excess revenue goes into **The Reserve**—a fund specifically for long-term sustainability. At scale, this fund can generate enough interest to keep servers running for decades without new Rooted joining.

### The plan

If Grove ever needs to wind down:
- Minimum 3 years notice to all users
- Full data export support
- Static archives uploaded to Internet Archive
- Centennial sites stay accessible

Even the worst case honors the promise.

## Opting out

Not everyone wants their words to outlive them. Centennial is automatic, but you control it:

**Disable preservation:** In your account settings, you can toggle off preservation. Your domain returns to the pool when your subscription ends.

**Delete your account:** Full deletion removes everything immediately. Your content is gone, your domain is released.

**Transfer to someone else:** In the future, you'll be able to designate a successor—someone who can maintain, archive, or delete your grove after you're gone.

The default is preservation because most people want their work to persist. But it's your grove. Your choice.

## Checking your progress

Your account settings show how many qualifying months you've accumulated toward Centennial status. Once you hit 12, you'll get an email confirming your grove has earned permanent status.

## Common questions

### What if I want to change my username?

While you're rooted, you can change your username anytime—Centennial follows your current username. When you eventually stop paying (if you ever do), whichever username you have at that moment becomes your preserved domain for the next century.

### What if someone wants my username after I'm gone?

Centennial domains are never reclaimed during the 100-year period. Even if someone else wants the username. The promise is the promise.

### What about my family?

If family members contact us with proof of relationship and a death certificate, we'll work with them. They can request:
- Transfer of the grove to another Wanderer
- Deletion of the content
- Keeping things as they are

Preservation is the default. Respect for family wishes is the exception.

### Is this legally binding?

Centennial is a commitment backed by Grove's financial structure, not a legal contract. The sustainability model, The Reserve, and succession planning exist specifically to make this promise keepable—not just words, but infrastructure designed for longevity.

*A hundred years is roughly how long an oak tree lives. That's the promise: your words can stand as long as an oak grows.*
