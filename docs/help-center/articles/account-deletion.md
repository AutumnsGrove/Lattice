# Deleting Your Account

If you decide to leave Grove, you can request deletion of your account and all associated data. Here's how it works.

## Before you request deletion

**Export your content first.** Once your account is deleted, we can't recover it. If there's anything you want to keep, export it before proceeding.

Go to **Account & Subscription** in your admin panel and scroll to the **Your Data** section. You can download all your posts, pages, and media information.

See [Exporting Your Content](/knowledge/help/exporting-your-content) for details on what's included.

## How to delete your account

Account deletion is handled through support to ensure you don't accidentally lose your data.

1. Go to **Account & Subscription** in your admin panel
2. Scroll to the **Danger Zone** section
3. Click the email link to contact us
4. Let us know you'd like to delete your account
5. We'll confirm you've exported anything you want to keep
6. We process the deletion within 30 days

We'll help you through the process and make sure you have everything you need before we remove anything.

## What gets deleted

**Immediately:**
- Your admin panel access
- Your blog becomes inaccessible
- Your posts are unpublished
- Your subdomain is released

**Within 24 hours:**
- Your account data is removed from active systems
- Your images are queued for deletion

**Within 90 days:**
- All data is permanently purged from backups
- Nothing recoverable remains

## What about my custom domain?

If you're on Oak or Evergreen with a custom domain:

**Domain you brought (BYOD):** The domain is yours. Remove the DNS records pointing to Grove, and the domain is free to use elsewhere.

**Domain included with Evergreen:** The domain is registered in your name. Request a transfer authorization code before deleting your account. We'll provide it within 48 hours. Once transferred to another registrar, the domain is fully yours.

## Data retention timeline

| Data Type | When Deleted |
|-----------|--------------|
| Blog posts | Immediately unpublished, purged within 24 hours |
| Images/media | Queued immediately, deleted within 7 days |
| Account info | Removed within 24 hours |
| Comments on your posts | Deleted with your posts |
| Your comments on other blogs | Anonymized, not deleted |
| Backup copies | Purged within 90 days |

## Cancellation vs. deletion

These are different things:

**Cancellation:** Stops your subscription. Your account remains, data stays, you just can't access paid features. Good if you might come back.

**Deletion:** Removes everything. Your account, data, and blog are gone permanently. Only do this if you're sure.

If you just want to stop paying, cancel your subscription instead. Your blog stays live on whatever plan you qualify for (or becomes inaccessible if you have no free tier equivalent).

## If you change your mind

**Before deletion completes:** Since we process deletions manually, you can contact us to cancel the request any time before we've started. Just reply to your original email.

**After deletion completes:** We cannot recover your account. The data is gone. You'd need to create a new account and start fresh.

## Legal requests

Under GDPR and similar laws, you have the right to request deletion of your personal data. Deleting your account fulfills this right. If you have specific questions about data deletion for legal purposes, contact us directly.

## A final note

We're sorry to see you go, but we respect your choice. Your data has always been yours—deleting it is your right.

If something about Grove drove you away, we'd genuinely appreciate knowing what. A quick note to support helps us improve. But no pressure—you can delete silently if you prefer.
