# What is Foliage?

Your corner of the grove should look like yours. Maybe you want warm earth tones. Maybe you want something bold. Maybe you want that perfect shade of blue that just *feels* right.

Foliage is Grove's theming system—the way you customize how your blog looks to visitors. From a simple accent color to full typography control, Foliage helps you make your space feel like home.

## Why Foliage exists

Most blogging platforms give you a handful of themes designed by someone else. They're fine, but they're not *you*. You end up with a site that looks like every other site using that same template.

Grove takes a different approach. Instead of rigid themes, Foliage offers layers of customization. Start with an accent color. Graduate to curated themes. Eventually, unlock full control over colors, typography, and spacing. Your blog evolves with you.

## How it works

Foliage offers different levels of customization depending on your tier:

**Accent color** (all paid tiers) — Pick a single color that tints your links, buttons, and interactive elements. It's the simplest change, but it makes a surprising difference.

**Curated themes** — Choose from ten hand-crafted themes, each with a distinct personality:
- *Grove* — Warm, earthy, the default
- *Minimal* — Clean, typography-focused
- *Night Garden* — Dark mode with gentle greens
- *Zine* — Bold, magazine-style layouts
- *Typewriter* — Retro, monospace, paper-textured
- And five more for different vibes

**Theme customizer** (Oak tier and above) — Full control over colors, typography, layout, and spacing. Adjust headings, body text, border radius, shadows—everything you'd expect from a professional design tool.

**Custom fonts** (Evergreen tier) — Upload your own fonts. If your brand uses a specific typeface, bring it with you.

All customizations respect accessibility. Foliage checks color contrast as you work, gently warning if your choices might make text hard to read.

## What this means for you

**Start simple, go deep.** You don't need to learn design theory to make your blog look good. Pick an accent color and a theme. Done. When you want more control, it's there.

**Your identity, your site.** The theme isn't just decoration—it's how visitors experience your words. A cozy brown feels different than a vibrant teal. That difference matters.

**Community themes** (Oak tier and above) — Browse themes created by other Grove Wanderers. Find something you love, import it, and make it your own.

**Changes preview instantly.** See exactly how your customizations look before saving. No guessing.

*Foliage is the visible part of the tree—the leaves that change with the seasons, the canopy that gives each grove its character. That's what your theme should be.*
