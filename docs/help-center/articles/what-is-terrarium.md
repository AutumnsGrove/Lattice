# What is Terrarium?

Remember decorating your first website? Picking a background, adding sparkly cursors, making the page unmistakably *yours*? Terrarium brings that energy to Grove—but with trees and fireflies instead of glitter.

Terrarium is a creative canvas where you compose scenes from nature components. Drag trees onto an open space. Add butterflies, mushrooms, flowers. Arrange them until the scene feels right. Then export your creation as a decoration for your blog.

## Why Terrarium exists

Grove blogs share a visual language: glassmorphism, seasonal colors, randomized forests. But within that language, every blog should feel different. Not just different colors or fonts—different *personality*.

Most platforms offer themes that other people designed. You pick one, maybe adjust a few settings, and your site looks like every other site using that theme.

Terrarium takes a different approach. Instead of choosing a pre-made decoration, you create your own. The component library—trees, creatures, flowers, ambient effects—ensures everything stays within Grove's aesthetic. You get creative freedom without visual chaos.

## How it works

The Terrarium workspace is a canvas with an asset palette on the left. Browse through categories—Trees, Creatures, Ground elements, Atmospheric effects—and drag components onto your scene.

Each component can be:
- **Positioned** anywhere on the canvas
- **Scaled** larger or smaller
- **Layered** in front of or behind other elements
- **Configured** with options (some trees change with seasons, some creatures animate)

A complexity meter at the bottom tracks your budget. This prevents decorations from becoming so heavy they slow down page loads. Think of it as a gentle constraint that encourages thoughtful composition over clutter.

When your scene feels complete, export it. Choose where it appears—header, sidebar, footer—and your decoration goes live on your blog.

**Note:** Terrarium is currently being built. The features described here represent what's coming, and the experience may evolve as development continues.

## What this means for you

**Your blog, unmistakably yours.** When someone visits your Grove, they'll see a decoration that exists nowhere else. That forest corner, that specific arrangement of elements—you made it.

**Creative freedom with guardrails.** Every component in Terrarium fits Grove's visual language. You can't accidentally create something garish because the palette is curated. It's like painting—but only with colors that harmonize.

**No code required.** This isn't CSS customization or template hacking. It's drag and drop. If you can arrange icons on a desktop, you can design in Terrarium.

**Export and forget.** Once your decoration is applied through Foliage (Grove's theming system), it just works. Seasons change. Dark mode adapts. Your creation lives on your blog without ongoing maintenance.

*A terrarium is a sealed world under glass—a miniature ecosystem you design, arrange, and watch grow. That's what you're building for your blog.*
