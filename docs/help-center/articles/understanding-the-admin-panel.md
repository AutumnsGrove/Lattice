# Understanding the Admin Panel

Once you're signed in, the admin panel is your home base. Here's a quick tour of what you'll find and where to find it.

## The dashboard

When you first log in, you land on your dashboard. It's intentionally simple: a quick snapshot of your blog's recent activity without overwhelming you with metrics.

What you'll see:
- Recent posts and their status
- Quick actions to create new content
- Any notifications that need attention

No anxiety-inducing analytics graphs. Just the basics.

## Main sections

### Blog Posts

This is where you'll spend most of your time. The posts section shows everything you've written, organized by date.

From here you can:
- Create new posts
- Edit existing posts
- View drafts vs. published content
- Delete posts you no longer want

Click any post title to jump into the editor.

### Pages

Pages are for content that isn't a blog post: your About page, a Contact page, a Now page. They live outside your main feed and are typically linked from your navigation.

Pages work almost identically to posts, just without dates or feed placement.

### [[curios|Curios]]

[[curios|Curios]] are embeddable widgets and interactive elements you can add to your blog — hit counters, guestbooks, mood rings, now-playing badges, and more. Think of them as the fun, personal touches that make your site feel alive.

> **Note:** Curios are actively being built. Some are available now, with more arriving over time.

### Images

Upload and manage your media files. Images are:
- Served through Grove's CDN for fast loading
- Available to use in any post or page
- Organized by upload date

You can also upload images directly when writing posts by dragging and dropping.

### Analytics

View your blog's performance metrics and visitor statistics. Available on Oak and Evergreen plans.

### [[trails|Trails]]

[[trails|Trails]] are your creative timeline and activity feed. Track your writing journey over time.

### Account

Manage your subscription, billing, and account settings:
- View your current plan and usage
- Update payment information
- Export your data
- Account deletion

### Settings

Configure how your blog looks and behaves:
- Typography (font selection)
- Accent color customization
- System health (for platform admins)

## Navigation tips

The admin panel uses a sidebar on larger screens and a bottom bar on mobile. Either way, the main sections are always one tap away.

A few shortcuts:
- Click your blog's name in the header to preview your live site
- The "New Post" button is always visible, no hunting required
- Settings changes save automatically (no "Submit" button to forget)

## What you won't find

Grove's admin panel is deliberately minimal. You won't see:
- Complex analytics dashboards
- SEO optimization scores
- Monetization settings
- Plugin marketplaces

This is intentional. Grove is for writing, not for running a media empire. If you want those features, Grove might not be the right fit, and that's okay.

## Getting comfortable

The best way to learn the admin panel is to click around. You can't break anything by exploring, and nothing publishes until you explicitly tell it to.

Create a test post. Upload an image. Change your theme. See how it feels.

*The admin panel is designed to get out of your way. Open it, write something, close it. Your blog handles the rest.*
