# The Markdown Editor

Grove's editor is where you'll spend most of your time. It's designed to get out of the way—write, format, publish.

## The basics

The editor uses Markdown, but you don't need to memorize syntax. Select any text and a floating toolbar appears with formatting options: bold, italic, headings, links, quotes, code, and lists.

If you prefer keyboard shortcuts:
- **⌘/Ctrl + B** — Bold
- **⌘/Ctrl + I** — Italic
- **⌘/Ctrl + S** — Save
- **Tab** — Indent

## Editor modes

The editor has three viewing modes, each suited to different parts of your writing workflow:

**Source mode** (⌘/Ctrl + 1): Just the editor. Clean, focused writing without distractions. Perfect for when you're in the flow and don't need to see the preview.

**Split mode** (⌘/Ctrl + 2): Editor and live preview side by side. Watch your Markdown render in real-time as you type. This is the default mode—best of both worlds.

**Preview mode** (⌘/Ctrl + 3): Preview only, no editing. Great for reviewing your work before publishing or reading through what you've written.

You can also press **⌘/Ctrl + P** to cycle through the modes.

The toolbar shows three icons for quick switching: a pen (Source), columns (Split), and book (Preview).

## Full preview

Click the expand icon in the toolbar to see exactly how your post will look on your published blog—with your theme, fonts, and styling applied. Press **Escape** to close.

## The status bar

At the bottom of the editor, you'll find:
- Current line and column position
- Total lines, words, and estimated reading time
- Current editor mode
- Draft save status (Unsaved → Saving draft → Draft saved ✓)

## Autosave and drafts

Grove saves your work to your browser automatically as you type. The status bar shows when changes are pending and confirms when they've been saved.

If you close the tab or your browser crashes, you'll see a prompt to restore your draft when you return. This local draft is separate from saving to the server—think of it as a safety net.

Click **Save** (or ⌘/Ctrl + S) to publish your changes to Grove's servers.

## Adding images

Three ways to add images:

1. **Drag and drop** — Drag an image file directly onto the editor
2. **Paste** — Copy an image and paste it (⌘/Ctrl + V)
3. **Manual** — Type the Markdown syntax: `![alt text](image-url)`

When you drag or paste, Grove uploads the image automatically and inserts the Markdown for you. You'll see a brief upload indicator, then the image appears in your preview.

## Zen mode

For distraction-free writing, press **⌘/Ctrl + Shift + Enter** to enter Zen mode. The editor goes fullscreen, the toolbar fades until you hover, and it's just you and your words.

Press **Escape** to exit.

Zen mode automatically enables typewriter mode, which keeps your current line vertically centered as you write—no more typing at the bottom of the screen.

## Line numbers

Line numbers appear on the left side of the editor. The current line is highlighted. They help you navigate longer posts and make it easier to reference specific sections when editing.
