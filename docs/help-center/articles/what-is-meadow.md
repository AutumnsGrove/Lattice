# What is Meadow?

> **Coming in Full Bloom:** Meadow is launching as part of Grove's Full Bloom release. The features described below represent what's coming—not what's available today.

Meadow is Grove's community feed: a shared space where bloggers can discover each other's work, react to posts, and have conversations.

Think of it as a cozy town square for Grove writers.

## How it works

When you publish a post on Grove, you can choose to share it to Meadow. Your post appears in the community feed alongside posts from other Grove bloggers who've done the same.

**Key points:**
- Sharing to Meadow is always opt-in, post by post
- Your blog exists independently. Meadow is just an extra layer
- Readers can discover your work even if they don't know your blog URL

## What you can do in Meadow

### Discover posts

Browse what other Grove bloggers are writing. The feed shows recent shared posts from across the community. No algorithm deciding what you see, just chronological posts from real people.

### React to posts

See something you appreciate? Leave a reaction. It's a lightweight way to say "I read this and it resonated" without the pressure of writing a comment.

Reactions are simple and positive. Think of them as digital nods of acknowledgment.

### Reply and discuss

Want to say more? You can reply to posts directly in Meadow. Conversations happen in context, attached to the post that sparked them.

Replies are public to other Meadow users but don't appear on the original blogger's site (unless they choose to display them).

### Vote (privately)

You can vote on posts to help surface quality content. Here's the thing: **vote counts are private**. You won't see a number next to posts, and neither will anyone else.

Why? Because visible vote counts create anxiety and gaming behavior. Grove wants you focused on writing and reading, not checking your score.

## Who can see what

| Content | Visibility |
|---------|-----------|
| Your shared post | All Meadow users |
| Your reactions | The post author + public |
| Your replies | All Meadow users |
| Your votes | Only you |

## Opting out

Not interested in community features? That's completely fine.

- Don't share posts to Meadow, and they won't appear there
- You can disable Meadow entirely in settings
- Your blog works exactly the same either way

Meadow is additive. It doesn't change how your blog functions; it just adds an optional social layer if you want it.

## Why Meadow exists

Most blogging platforms are islands. You write into the void and hope someone finds you through search engines or social media promotion.

Meadow creates a built-in audience of fellow writers. People who understand the craft, appreciate the effort, and might become your most engaged readers.

It's not trying to be Twitter or a viral content machine. It's more like a writing group that happens to be online.

## Meadow etiquette

The community is small and intentional. A few norms:

- **Read before reacting**: Reactions mean more when they're genuine
- **Keep replies thoughtful**: Quality over quantity
- **Support other writers**: Everyone's figuring this out together
- **Don't spam**: Sharing every post dilutes the feed

There's no formal moderation system yet. We're trusting that people who choose Grove are here in good faith.

*Meadow is optional, but it's worth exploring. Some of the best connections happen when writers find each other.*
