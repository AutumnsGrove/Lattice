# What is Amber?

Every image you upload, every attachment you send, every file that lives on your Grove—it's all stored somewhere. Amber makes that somewhere visible.

Amber is your storage dashboard. See what's using your space, organize your files, export your data, and clean up what you don't need. Your digital belongings, preserved and accessible.

## Why Amber exists

Most platforms hide storage behind the scenes. You upload images, they go... somewhere. You have a quota, but you don't know what's filling it. When you run low, you're stuck guessing what to delete.

Amber brings everything into the light. Every file has a place. Every bit of your quota is accounted for. You can see exactly what's using your space and make informed decisions about what stays and what goes.

## How it works

Amber provides a unified view of all your Grove storage:

**Storage dashboard** — A visual breakdown showing how much space you're using and what's using it. Images, attachments, profile assets, custom fonts—all categorized.

**File browser** — Browse your files by type or by source (blog images, email attachments, etc.). Preview images and documents without downloading.

**Export and download** — Download individual files or everything at once. Your data is yours, always accessible.

**Cleanup tools** — Delete files you don't need. Items go to trash for 30 days before permanent deletion, giving you a safety net.

**Storage add-ons** — Need more space? Purchase additional storage without changing your plan.

**Note:** Amber is currently being built. The features described here represent what's coming.

## What this means for you

**Know where your space goes.** No more guessing. If you're approaching your quota, you'll see exactly why.

**Your files, organized.** Whether you uploaded an image last week or last year, you can find it.

**Export anytime.** Your data doesn't belong to Grove—it belongs to you. Download everything whenever you want.

**Storage that scales with you.** Start small, add more when you need it. Pay for what you actually use.
