# What are Tiers?

Everyone starts somewhere. Grove's tiers are named for where you are on your journey.

Four subscription levels—Seedling, Sapling, Oak, and Evergreen—each offering more as your grove grows. No hidden upsells. No surprise feature gates. Just clear options for what you need right now.

## The tiers

### Seedling — $8/month

**For trying things out.**

You're planting your first blog. You're not sure if you'll stick with it. You want a space without making a big commitment.

Seedling gives you:
- Up to 50 posts
- 1 GB storage
- Basic theming with accent colors
- Access to the community

It's enough to genuinely explore whether Grove is right for you.

### Sapling — $12/month

**For regular bloggers.**

You've decided this is your space. You post regularly. You want more room to grow.

Sapling includes everything in Seedling, plus:
- Up to 250 posts
- 5 GB storage
- Full theming options
- Email forwarding to your `@grove.place` address
- Read-only [[ivy]] access
- [[rings]] analytics
- [[trails]] personal roadmaps
- [[centennial]] eligibility after 12 months

Most hobbyist bloggers live comfortably here.

### Oak — $25/month

**For serious writers.**

Your blog is part of your identity. Maybe it supports your work or side business. You need professional features.

Oak includes everything in Sapling, plus:
- Unlimited posts
- 20 GB storage
- Theme customizer (full control over colors, typography, spacing)
- Bring Your Own Domain (use your own domain name)
- Full Ivy email capabilities
- Community theme access

No more limits. Your grove grows as big as you need.

### Evergreen — $35/month

**For professionals.**

You want Grove to handle everything. Domain search, registration, priority support, all the bells and whistles.

Evergreen includes everything in Oak, plus:
- 100 GB storage
- Custom fonts
- [[forage]] domain discovery (included)
- Domain registration (one domain included)
- Priority support

The full-service option for people who value their time.

## Growing between tiers

**Upgrading is instant.** Switch from Seedling to Sapling and your new features activate immediately. The price difference is prorated.

**Downgrading is safe.** Move to a lower tier and everything stays until you hit the new limits. You won't lose posts—you just can't add more until you're under the cap.

**No pressure.** Tiers exist because different people have different needs, not because we're trying to push you into spending more.

## What this means for you

**Start where it makes sense.** If you're trying blogging for the first time, Seedling is fine. You can always grow.

**Clear value at each level.** Every tier adds meaningful features. Nothing is locked away arbitrarily.

**Annual discounts available.** Pay yearly and save. The commitment makes sense once you know you're staying.

**Free isn't an option.** Grove doesn't have a free tier. Running a quality platform costs money. We'd rather charge fairly than sell your data or show ads.

*Seedlings become saplings. Saplings become oaks. Oaks become evergreens—trees that stay green through every season. That's the journey.*
