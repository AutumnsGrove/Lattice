# What is Waystone?

You're reading Waystone right now.

Waystone is Grove's help system—the searchable documentation, contextual help buttons, and guides built directly into the platform. When you're lost, Waystone is the trail marker showing the way forward.

## Why Waystone exists

Most platforms send you to external docs sites when you need help. Different domain, different login, different design. You lose your place, lose your context, lose your train of thought.

Grove keeps help integrated. Click a help button in the admin panel, and you're reading relevant documentation without leaving Grove. Search for an answer, and you're searching from where you already are. Help is everywhere you need it, not tucked away somewhere else.

## How it works

Waystone provides help in several ways:

**Contextual help buttons** — Throughout the admin panel, you'll see question-mark icons. Click one, and you get documentation about exactly what you're looking at.

**Searchable articles** — Looking for something specific? Search finds articles by keyword, title, and content.

**Category browsing** — Not sure what to search for? Browse categories like Getting Started, Writing & Publishing, Customization, and more.

**How-it-works articles** — Wondering what a feature does? These articles (like this one) explain the thinking behind Grove's tools.

All help content stays updated as the platform evolves. When something changes, the documentation changes with it.

## What this means for you

**Help is always close.** No hunting for a separate docs site. No context switching.

**Honest documentation.** Waystone tells you what Grove can and can't do. If a feature has limitations, the docs say so.

**Self-service first.** Most questions have answers here. You can find them at your own pace, anytime.

**Human support when needed.** Waystone handles common questions. When you need a person, Porch (our support system) is there.

*Waystones are the markers travelers leave along forest paths—guiding those who follow, showing the way forward. That's what good documentation does.*
