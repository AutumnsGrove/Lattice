# What is my Garden?

Your garden is where all your [blooms](/knowledge/help/what-are-blooms) live together. It's the page at `yourname.grove.place/garden` where visitors can browse everything you've written.

## The short version

Think of it like this: your [grove](/knowledge/help/what-is-my-grove) is your whole space. Your garden is the part where you've planted and tended your writing. Each piece you publish is a bloom. The garden is the collection of all of them.

## Why "garden" instead of "blog index"?

A garden is where you tend what grows. It's cultivated, arranged, cared for. You don't just dump seeds and walk away—you plant things with intention, water them, maybe rearrange them as they grow.

"Blog index" sounds like a database query. A garden sounds like somewhere you'd want to stroll through.

## What's in your garden?

Your garden shows all your published blooms, typically organized by date (newest first). Depending on your [foliage](/knowledge/help/what-is-foliage) settings, you might also see:

- Featured or pinned blooms at the top
- Categories or tags for filtering
- Excerpts or full content in the listings
- Pagination for longer collections

The garden is the main entry point for visitors who want to explore your writing.

## How visitors experience your garden

Someone lands at `yourname.grove.place`. Maybe they see your homepage, maybe they land directly in your garden. Either way, they're strolling through—reading titles, scanning excerpts, clicking into blooms that catch their eye.

It's not a feed designed to maximize engagement. It's a space designed to invite exploration.

## The metaphor chain

Here's how it all connects:

> You **wander** into the Grove → You **take root** → Your **tree** grows → Your **grove** flourishes → It **blooms**

Your grove is your space. Your garden is the cultivated area within it. Your blooms are the individual flowers growing there.

## Garden and accessibility

While "garden" appears throughout the interface, screen readers and search engines see "blog posts" or "articles" in the underlying markup. The Grove language is what you see and feel. Standard terms remain for anyone who needs them.
