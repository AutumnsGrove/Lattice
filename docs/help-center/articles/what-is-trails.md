# What is Trails?

Every project is a journey. Trails lets you share yours.

Trails is Grove's personal roadmap feature—a beautiful way to show where you've been, where you are, and where you're headed. Whether you're building a creative project, outlining upcoming blog content, or tracking long-term goals, Trails makes the path visible.

## Why Trails exists

Building in public has become popular for good reason. Sharing your journey creates accountability, invites support, and lets people follow along with something they care about.

But most project tracking tools are built for productivity, not storytelling. They're spreadsheets with prettier colors. Trails takes a different approach: roadmaps that feel like roadmaps. Progress you can see at a glance. A narrative of where you're going and how far you've come.

## How it works

A Trail is a collection of waypoints—milestones or planned items on your journey. Each waypoint has:

**Status** — Planned, in progress, complete, or deferred. At a glance, readers see what's done and what's coming.

**Description** — What this milestone means. Context for the journey.

**Optional dates** — Target dates or timeframes if you want to share them.

**Links** — Connect waypoints to blog posts, external resources, or whatever's relevant.

You can organize waypoints into phases (like "Foundation," "Growth," "Polish") or keep them as a simple flat list. The choice depends on your project.

Your Trail lives on your blog at a URL you choose (`/roadmap`, `/trail`, or something custom). Public trails are visible to everyone; private trails are just for you.

**Note:** Trails is currently being built and will be available to Sapling tier and above.

## What this means for you

**Show your work.** Let readers and followers see what you're building. Transparency builds connection.

**Track your progress.** Even if you keep your Trail private, it's a satisfying way to watch milestones turn from "planned" to "complete."

**Beautiful presentation.** This isn't a project management tool. It's designed to look good on your blog, with nature-themed visuals that match Grove's aesthetic.

**Your journey, your way.** Phases, flat lists, sparse or detailed—Trails adapts to how you work.

*Trails wind through the forest, marking where others have walked. They show the journey, not just the destination.*
