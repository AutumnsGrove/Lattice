# What are Curios?

Remember when personal websites had guestbooks? Hit counters? Blinking "under construction" signs? Those little touches that said "someone lives here"?

Curios brings that energy back.

Your cabinet of wonders. Guestbooks where visitors leave their mark. Shrines dedicated to things you love. Custom cursors that follow visitors around the page. Under-construction badges, link gardens, hit counters—all the delightful chaos of the old web, curated for the modern one.

## Why Curios exists

Modern websites often feel anonymous. Templates that could belong to anyone. Smooth, polished, interchangeable. There's nothing wrong with polish, but something gets lost when every site feels like a product page.

Curios is the opposite of that. It's the weird stuff. The personal touches. The little details that make visitors pause and smile. It's not trying to look professional—it's trying to feel _lived in_.

This isn't your theme (that's Foliage). This isn't the editor (that's Flow). This isn't custom decorations you design (that's Terrarium). Curios is the _stuff_. The tchotchkes on the shelf. The wind chimes by the door.

## How it works

Configure your curios in the admin panel, then drop them anywhere in your content with a simple directive — `::curio-name[]::` in your markdown, and it comes alive.

### The collection

**Guestbooks** — The classic. Visitors leave messages, you collect memories. Moderated automatically (spam filtering via Thorn) but ultimately under your control. Delete entries you don't want. Keep the ones that make you smile.

**Hit counters** — That nostalgic page view counter, faithfully ticking upward every time someone visits. Because knowing 847 people have been here feels different than knowing zero.

**Now playing** — Show visitors what you're listening to. Connects to your music service and displays the current track, album art and all.

**Polls** — Ask your visitors a question. See what they think. Simple, fun, and a little window into who's reading.

**Mood ring** — A color that shifts with your mood. Set it yourself or let it drift — a tiny emotional barometer on your page.

**Badges** — Earned and collected, displayed proudly. The digital equivalent of pins on a jacket.

**Status badges** — Site status indicators. Up, down, maintenance — visitors know what's happening.

**Activity status** — A little line that says what you're up to right now. "Busy with tea." "Writing." "Away."

**Blogroll** — Links to the blogs and sites you read and admire. The old web tradition, alive and well.

**Webrings** — Navigate between sites in a ring. Previous, next, hub. The original decentralized discovery network.

**Link gardens** — Curated collections of links to places you love. Organized into beds, tended like a garden.

**Bookmark shelf** — Your reading list, displayed as a shelf. Cover images, authors, "currently reading" and "favorite" badges.

**Artifacts** — Fortune cookies, magic 8-balls, and other interactive curiosities. Little moments of serendipity.

**Shrines** — Dedicated spaces for things you love. A favorite album. A beloved game. A character who means something to you. Display images, add captions, build a little altar.

### Site-wide layers

Some curios don't live inside your content — they wrap around it.

**Custom cursors** — Change what visitors see when they move their mouse. Leaves, butterflies, sparkle trails, or upload your own tiny image. Subtle touches that create atmosphere.

**Ambient sounds** — Soft rain. Crackling fire. Forest birdsong. Optional background audio that visitors can mute or adjust. Atmosphere you can hear.

### Embedding curios

Any embeddable curio can be placed directly in your posts and pages. In the editor, just type:

```
::guestbook[]::
::hitcounter[]::
::nowplaying[]::
::poll[your-poll-id]::
```

The directive turns into a live, interactive widget when visitors see your page. Configure each curio's settings in **Admin → Curios**, and the embedded version reflects your configuration automatically.

## What this means for you

**Your space, your personality.** Curios isn't about conversion rates or engagement metrics. It's about making your corner of the internet feel like _yours_.

**Visitors can participate.** Guestbooks turn visitors into guests. Polls invite opinions. Activity statuses say "someone's home." Your site becomes a place people remember because they were part of it.

**Drop them anywhere.** Curios aren't confined to a sidebar or a special page. Put a hit counter in a blog post. A poll in your about page. A now-playing widget in your footer. They go where you want them.

**Old web energy, new web infrastructure.** The charm of Geocities without the broken images and dead links. Curios load quickly, adapt to dark mode, work on mobile, and respect reduced motion preferences.

**Everything is optional.** You don't have to use any of this. But if you miss the weird, wonderful, personal web — here it is.

_A curio is something unusual and intriguing—a curiosity that makes you pause and look closer. That's what your site should have._
