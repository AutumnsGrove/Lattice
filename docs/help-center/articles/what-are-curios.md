# What are Curios?

Remember when personal websites had guestbooks? Hit counters? Blinking "under construction" signs? Those little touches that said "someone lives here"?

Curios brings that energy back.

Your cabinet of wonders. Guestbooks where visitors leave their mark. Shrines dedicated to things you love. Custom cursors that follow visitors around the page. Under-construction badges, link gardens, hit counters—all the delightful chaos of the old web, curated for the modern one.

## Why Curios exists

Modern websites often feel anonymous. Templates that could belong to anyone. Smooth, polished, interchangeable. There's nothing wrong with polish, but something gets lost when every site feels like a product page.

Curios is the opposite of that. It's the weird stuff. The personal touches. The little details that make visitors pause and smile. It's not trying to look professional—it's trying to feel *lived in*.

This isn't your theme (that's Foliage). This isn't the editor (that's Flow). This isn't custom decorations you design (that's Terrarium). Curios is the *stuff*. The tchotchkes on the shelf. The wind chimes by the door.

## How it works

Curios offers a collection of interactive and decorative elements you can add to your site:

**Guestbooks** — The classic. Visitors leave messages, you collect memories. Moderated automatically (spam filtering via Thorn) but ultimately under your control. Delete entries you don't want. Keep the ones that make you smile.

**Custom cursors** — Change what visitors see when they move their mouse. Leaves, butterflies, sparkle trails, or upload your own tiny image. Subtle touches that create atmosphere.

**Shrines** — Dedicated spaces for things you love. A favorite album. A beloved game. A character who means something to you. Display images, add captions, build a little altar.

**Under-construction badges** — Sometimes you're still building. Let visitors know with a charming badge that says "come back later."

**Link gardens** — Curated collections of links to places you love. The blogroll, reimagined.

**More coming** — Hit counters, web badges, button collections, and other oddities currently brewing in the workshop.

## What this means for you

**Your space, your personality.** Curios isn't about conversion rates or engagement metrics. It's about making your corner of the internet feel like *yours*.

**Visitors can participate.** Guestbooks turn visitors into guests. They leave something behind. Your site becomes a place people remember.

**Old web energy, new web infrastructure.** The charm of Geocities without the broken images and dead links. Curios elements work reliably, load quickly, and adapt to dark mode.

**Everything is optional.** You don't have to use any of this. But if you miss the weird, wonderful, personal web—here it is.

*A curio is something unusual and intriguing—a curiosity that makes you pause and look closer. That's what your site should have.*
