# Contacting Support

When you need help with something the documentation doesn't cover, here's how to reach a real person.

## How to contact us

**Email:** [hello@grove.place](mailto:hello@grove.place)

That's it. No ticket system, no chatbot maze, no "press 1 for billing". Just send an email and a human will read it.

## Who responds

Right now, Grove is a one-person operation. Autumn reads every support email personally. This means:

- You're talking to the person who built the platform
- Responses are thoughtful, not scripted
- Complex issues get actual attention
- Sometimes it takes a bit longer than a big company's automated reply

## Response times

| Plan | Typical Response |
|------|------------------|
| Seedling | Within 48 hours |
| Sapling | Within 48 hours |
| Oak | Within 24 hours |
| Evergreen | Within 24 hours (priority queue) |

These are typical times, not guarantees. Life happens. But most emails get a response within a day.

## What to include

When reaching out, including these details helps get you a faster, more useful response:

**For account issues:**
- The email address associated with your account
- Your blog URL (e.g., `yourusername.grove.place`)

**For technical problems:**
- What you were trying to do
- What happened instead
- Any error messages you saw (screenshots help)
- Which browser you're using

**For billing questions:**
- Your account email
- The date of the charge in question

You don't need to write a novel. A few sentences with the relevant details is perfect.

## What support can help with

- Account access issues
- Technical problems with your blog
- Billing questions and refund requests
- Feature questions
- Bug reports
- General questions about using Grove

## What support can't do

- Write your blog posts for you
- Provide web design or consulting services (outside of Evergreen onboarding hours)
- Help with third-party tools or services not related to Grove
- Offer legal or tax advice

## Before you email

Check if your question is already answered:

1. **Help Center** — You're here. Browse the other articles.
2. **Status page** — If Grove seems down, check if there's a known incident.
3. **Search your issue** — Many common questions have documented solutions.

That said, don't hesitate to reach out if you're stuck. "I tried searching but couldn't find the answer" is a perfectly valid email.

## Feedback and suggestions

Want to suggest a feature or share feedback about Grove? Same email address:

**[hello@grove.place](mailto:hello@grove.place)**

Feature requests are always welcome. Can't promise everything gets built, but everything gets read and considered.

## A note on tone

You're writing to a person, not a corporation. Be as casual or formal as you like. Questions like "hey, my blog broke, help?" are totally fine. So is a detailed technical explanation. Whatever works for you.

*Grove is small by design. When you email support, you're reaching the person who cares most about making this platform work for you.*
