# Wanderers and Pathfinders

Grove doesn't call you a "user" or a "member." Those words feel transactional. Instead, we use language that reflects how people actually move through this place.

## You're a Wanderer

Everyone who enters Grove is a [[wanderer|Wanderer]]. Reading a blog, browsing the [[meadow|Meadow]], exploring what's here. No account required, no commitment expected.

Wandering is a disposition, not a status. Even after you plant your blog and become part of the community, you're still a wanderer at heart. You still explore. You still discover new voices. The paths wind on.

## Taking Root

When you subscribe and create your blog, you take root. You've planted your tree in the grove. You have a home here now.

**[[rooted|The Rooted]]** are people who've made that choice. They write, they publish, they tend their little corner of the forest. But they haven't stopped wandering. They've just found a place to come back to.

## Pathfinders

Some people walk the grove long enough to know every path. They help newcomers find their way, answer questions, and make the community warmer just by being in it.

These are **[[pathfinder|Pathfinders]]**. It's not a role you apply for or earn through tenure. The [[wayfinder|Wayfinder]] (Autumn, who built this place) appoints Pathfinders based on trust and contribution.

If you see someone with a Pathfinder badge in the [[meadow|Meadow]], they're a good person to ask if you're lost.

## The Wayfinder

There's one [[wayfinder|Wayfinder]]: Autumn. She tends the grove, finds the way forward, and shows it to others.

Where wanderers seek paths, the Wayfinder creates them.

## What about subscription tiers?

Subscription tiers (Wanderer, Seedling, Sapling, Oak, Evergreen) are separate from identity. Tiers describe what you pay and what features you access. Identity describes who you are in the community.

You might notice the free tier is also called Wanderer. That's intentional — it's the natural starting point. Everyone begins as a wanderer, and your first steps in the grove are free. The identity and the tier share a name because they share a spirit: exploring, discovering, finding your place.

You can be a [[rooted|Rooted]] Seedling or a [[rooted|Rooted]] Evergreen. You can be a [[pathfinder|Pathfinder]] at any tier. The two systems are separate — identity is about who you are in the community, tiers are about what features you access.
