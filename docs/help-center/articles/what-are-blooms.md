# What are Blooms?

In Grove, we don't call them posts. We call them blooms.

## The short version

A bloom is a piece of writing you publish on your Grove blog. An essay, a thought, a story, a rant, a love letter to a topic you can't stop thinking about. Whatever it is, when you hit publish, it blooms in your garden for others to see.

## Why "bloom"?

A bloom is a flower opening. A moment of expression, color, and beauty. It's what your grove produces. It's why visitors come.

The metaphor matters. Posts feel transactional—content to be consumed, metrics to be counted. Blooms feel alive. Something that grew from your thinking, opened when it was ready, and now stands in your garden for others to see.

## Where blooms live

Your blooms live in your [garden](/knowledge/help/what-is-my-garden)—the collection page at `yourname.grove.place/garden`. Each individual bloom has its own URL: `yourname.grove.place/garden/the-slug-you-chose`.

You write blooms in [Arbor](/knowledge/help/what-is-arbor), Grove's admin panel. The editor is called [Flow](/knowledge/help/what-is-flow)—a clean, focused space where words take shape.

## The journey of a bloom

1. You have a thought
2. You write it down in Flow
3. You save it as a draft (it's tucked away, not yet blooming)
4. When it's ready, you publish
5. It blooms in your garden
6. Visitors can find it, read it, maybe leave a comment in the [Reeds](/knowledge/help/what-are-reeds)

## Blooms and accessibility

While we use "bloom" in the interface, screen readers and search engines see "blog post" or "article" in the underlying markup. The Grove language is what you see and feel. Standard terms remain for anyone who needs them.

## The metaphor chain

Here's how the language fits together:

> You **wander** into the Grove → You **take root** → Your **tree** grows → Your **grove** flourishes → It **blooms**

Your grove is your space. Your garden is where your writing lives. Your blooms are what you've written.
