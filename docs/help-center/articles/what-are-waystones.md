# What are Waystones?

You probably just tapped one to get here.

Waystones are the little contextual help markers scattered across Grove. They give you a quick explanation of what you're looking at — a term, a feature, a concept — without pulling you away from what you were doing. If you want the full story, there's usually a link to a knowledge base article. But often the Waystone itself is enough.

## Why they exist

Grove uses a lot of its own language. Arbor, Meadow, Porch, Clearing, Shade — these aren't standard platform terms, and if you've never been here before, seeing something like "Meadow" in your admin panel is going to raise questions.

Waystones are how Grove speaks to you without making you go read a manual. Instead of dumping a glossary on you and hoping you memorize it, the explanations live right where the terms are. You see a word you don't recognize, you tap the Waystone, and now you know.

## What they look like

Waystones show up in two ways:

**Inline markers** — Throughout articles and content, you'll see text that looks a little different: subtly underlined or styled to stand out from the surrounding words. Tap it, and a small box appears with a brief explanation of that term. Sometimes there are related terms listed underneath that take you to other Waystones, so you can follow the thread at your own pace.

**Help circles** — In the admin panel and across the site, you'll see small question-mark icons, usually next to a heading or label. These are slightly bigger Waystones. They open the same kind of popup, but tend to explain the feature or section you're in rather than a single term.

Both types open a popup right where you are. No page navigation, no new tab, no losing your place.

## What happens when you tap one

A small box appears with:

- **A title** — the term or feature being explained
- **A brief description** — a sentence or two covering the essentials
- **The first section of a knowledge base article** — enough context to get oriented
- **A link to the full article** — if you want to go deeper, it's one tap away
- **Related terms** — other Waystones that might help fill in the picture

That's it. Read what you need, close the box, and you're right back where you were.

## Waystones vs. the Knowledge Base

These are two different things that work together.

**Waystones** are the trail markers. They're contextual, brief, and embedded where you need them. They meet you where you already are.

**The Knowledge Base** is the library. It's where the full articles live — searchable, browsable, organized by category. When a Waystone links to "read the full article," that's where it takes you.

You're reading a Knowledge Base article right now. The Waystone you tapped earlier showed you just enough to decide if you wanted to come here and read more. That's the system working as intended.

*In the forest, a waystone is a marker left along the path — not the destination itself, but the thing that keeps you from getting lost. That's the idea.*
