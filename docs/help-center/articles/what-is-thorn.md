# What is Thorn?

Every grove needs protection. [[thorn]] is Grove's.

[[thorn]] is the automated content moderation system that helps enforce Grove's [Acceptable Use Policy](/knowledge/legal/acceptable-use-policy). It reviews content for harmful material—not by keyword matching, but by understanding context. And it does this without human surveillance.

## Why Thorn exists

Content moderation is a hard problem. Do nothing, and platforms become cesspools. Over-moderate, and legitimate expression gets silenced. Many platforms rely on armies of human moderators who read every flagged post—a job that's psychologically damaging and invasive to user privacy.

Grove takes a different path. Thorn uses AI to review content, but with strict privacy protections built in:

- No human reads your content during automated review
- Content is deleted immediately after analysis
- Your writing never trains any AI model
- We retain only the decision, not the content

Protection without surveillance. That's the goal.

## How it works

When you publish a post or submit a comment, Thorn reviews it automatically. The system checks for violations of our acceptable use policy—things like hate speech, harassment, illegal content, and spam.

**Context matters.** Thorn doesn't just look for bad words. It understands context. An article about the history of a slur isn't treated the same as someone using that slur to attack another person.

**Transparency.** You know moderation exists. The rules are public. If something gets flagged, you'll know why.

**Appeals.** If you think Thorn made a mistake, you can appeal. Humans review appeals (with strict privacy protocols).

**Graduated response.** First-time issues get warnings. Repeated violations escalate. We don't ban people without clear patterns of problematic behavior.

## What this means for you

**Your content is reviewed automatically.** This happens on every publish. Most content passes without issue—you won't even notice.

**Privacy is maintained.** The review happens without human eyes on your content. Your words stay private.

**Fair enforcement.** Context-aware AI is better than keyword filters. Legitimate discussions don't get caught in over-aggressive matching.

**You'll know if there's an issue.** Thorn tells you when something's flagged and why. No silent shadowbans.
