# What is Forage?

Before you can plant, you have to search.

Forage is Grove's AI-powered domain discovery tool—a way to find the perfect domain name without the exhausting manual search. Tell it about your project, your vibe, your budget, and it returns a curated list of available domains that actually fit. Weeks of frustrating searching, condensed into hours.

## Why Forage exists

Finding a good domain is miserable. You think of a perfect name. Taken. You try variations. Taken, or available but $10,000. You brainstorm more ideas. Check each one manually. Hit rate limit walls on registrar sites. Eventually settle for something that's "fine" because you're exhausted.

Forage fixes this with AI orchestration. Instead of checking domains one by one, an AI generates hundreds of candidates based on what you tell it. Then it checks them all, filters for availability and reasonable pricing, and gives you a curated list. The creative brainstorming and tedious checking happen in the background while you do other things.

## How it works

Start by answering a few questions:
- What's your project about?
- What vibe are you going for?
- Any keywords that must or can't appear?
- What's your budget for a domain?

Forage takes your answers and spins up an AI session. The AI:

1. **Generates candidates** — Hundreds of domain name ideas based on your input
2. **Evaluates quality** — Rates each candidate for memorability, brand potential, and fit
3. **Checks availability** — Uses RDAP (the domain registry protocol) to verify which are actually available
4. **Filters by price** — Removes premium domains outside your budget
5. **Curates the list** — Returns the top ~25 options with explanations for why each might work

The whole process runs in the background. When it's done, you get an email with your results.

**Privacy note:** Forage uses DeepSeek v3.2 through providers with zero data retention. Your project ideas don't become AI training data.

## What this means for you

**Hours, not weeks.** The time from "I need a domain" to "here are 25 good options" shrinks dramatically.

**Creative options you wouldn't find.** AI can explore word combinations and creative variants faster than manual brainstorming.

**Actually available.** Every result has been checked. No false hope from domains that look available but aren't.

**Budget-aware.** Forage won't show you $5,000 domains if your budget is $20.

**No pressure.** Forage gives you options. You make the final choice. Buy through any registrar you like.
