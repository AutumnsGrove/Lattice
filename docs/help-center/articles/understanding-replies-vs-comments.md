# Understanding Replies vs. Comments

> **Coming in Full Bloom:** The comments and replies system is launching as part of [[your-grove|Grove]]'s Full Bloom release. The features described below represent what's coming—not what's available today.

[[your-grove|Grove]] has two ways for readers to respond to your posts: replies and comments. They work differently, and that's intentional.

## The short version

**Replies** are private messages to you. Only you see them.

**Comments** are public. They appear on your post for everyone to read, but only after you approve them.

## Replies: Private feedback

When a reader leaves a reply, it goes directly to you. No one else sees it. Think of it like someone emailing you about your post, except they don't need to find your email address.

Replies are good for:
- Readers who want to share a thought but not publicly
- Corrections or typo fixes you might want to handle quietly
- Personal responses that don't need an audience
- People who are shy about public commenting

**No approval needed.** Replies land in your inbox immediately. They're a private channel between you and your reader.

**No limits.** Paid plans get unlimited replies on their posts. Free accounts can send unlimited private replies to other bloggers.

## Comments: Public conversation

Comments appear on your post, visible to everyone who reads it. But there's a catch: you approve them first.

When someone leaves a comment:
1. It goes into your moderation queue
2. You review it in **Posts → Comments**
3. You approve, reject, or ignore it
4. Approved comments appear publicly on the post

This gives you control. Your blog isn't a free-for-all. You decide what conversations happen in your space.

**Free accounts** can leave up to 20 public comments per week on other blogs.

**Paid accounts** have no comment limits.

## Why the distinction?

Most platforms treat all responses the same. Grove separates them because they serve different purposes:

- Sometimes people want to tell you something without performing for an audience
- Sometimes you want feedback but don't want to moderate a comments section
- Sometimes a post invites public discussion; sometimes it doesn't

By keeping replies private by default, readers can reach you without worrying about how their words look to strangers. By requiring approval for comments, you keep control of your public space.

## For blog owners: What you see

In your admin panel:

**Replies** show up under your post, marked as private. You can read them, but there's nothing to approve. They're just for you.

**Comments** appear in your moderation queue at **Posts → Comments**. New comments wait there until you take action.

You can:
- **Approve** — Comment goes live on the post
- **Reject** — Comment is removed, commenter isn't notified
- **Ignore** — Comment stays in queue (useful if you're unsure)

## For readers: How to leave feedback

When you're on someone's Grove blog:

**To send a private reply:** Use the reply form. Your message goes only to the author.

**To leave a public comment:** Use the comment form. Your comment will be reviewed before appearing.

Both options are usually available at the bottom of posts, though blog owners can disable either one.

## Can I turn off comments? Replies?

Yes. In **Settings → Comments**, you can:
- Disable public comments entirely
- Disable private replies
- Enable both
- Choose your preference per post

Some bloggers want active comments sections. Others prefer just replies. Some want neither. Your blog, your call.

*Replies let readers reach you. Comments let readers join the conversation. Both are optional.*
