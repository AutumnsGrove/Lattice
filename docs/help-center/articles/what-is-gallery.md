# What is Gallery?

Gallery is a curio for showcasing visual work—art, photography, collections, or anything that deserves to be seen beautifully.

Your blog posts are great for stories and essays, but sometimes you just want to show things. A portfolio of illustrations. Photos from a trip. Fan art you've collected. Screenshots of projects you're proud of. Gallery gives visual content the space it deserves.

## How it works

Gallery creates a dedicated space for images:

**Grid layouts** — Your images arrange themselves in a responsive grid that adapts to different screen sizes. No manual sizing needed.

**Lightbox viewing** — Click any image to see it full-size in a beautiful overlay. Navigate between images with arrow keys or swipe on mobile.

**Captions and context** — Add titles and descriptions to individual images. Tell the story behind each piece.

**Collections** — Organize images into themed collections. "Inktober 2025." "Character designs." "Things that spark joy."

**Privacy options** — Keep galleries private for personal archives, or share them with the world.

## What this means for you

**Visual work gets visual space.** Stop cramming images into blog posts where they don't fit. Gallery treats your visual content as the main event.

**Portfolio-ready.** Artists, photographers, designers—Gallery gives you a clean, professional way to showcase work without building a separate portfolio site.

**Curated collections.** Not everything needs a thousand words. Sometimes you just want to share what you've seen, made, or collected.
