# What is Centennial?

Some trees outlive the people who planted them.

Centennial is Grove's promise: after 12 cumulative months of Sapling+ membership, your `yourname.grove.place` domain stays online for 100 years. Even if you stop paying. Even after you're gone.

## Why Centennial exists

Most platforms don't think about what happens to your content after you leave. Stop paying, your site disappears. Die, your site dies with you (eventually). All those words, all those memories—gone.

That feels wrong to us.

Writers deserve the option of permanence. Not forced permanence—you can always choose to delete. But the *option* to leave something behind. To know that the grove you planted might still be standing when your grandchildren search for your name.

## How it works

Centennial status unlocks automatically when you've been a paying member at Sapling tier ($12/month) or above for 12 cumulative months.

| Path | Timeline |
|------|----------|
| Yearly subscription | Instant on first renewal |
| Monthly subscription | After 12 monthly payments |
| Mixed (upgrade/downgrade) | Months add up over time |

The 100-year clock starts from when you first created your Grove account—not when you earned Centennial. If you planted in 2026 and earned Centennial in 2027, your site is preserved until 2126.

**What gets preserved:**
- Your published posts remain publicly accessible
- Your RSS feed keeps working
- Your domain stays reserved

**What happens if you stop paying:**
- Your site becomes read-only (you can't edit or publish new posts)
- Visitors can still read everything
- Reactivate anytime by resuming your subscription

## What this means for you

**Permanence as a choice.** You don't have to do anything to earn this—just stay at Sapling or above for a year. The promise kicks in automatically.

**Your words outlast you.** If you want them to. Some people find comfort knowing their writing might still be there, quietly existing, long after they're gone.

**Opt-out available.** Not everyone wants digital immortality. You can always delete your grove entirely. Centennial doesn't force preservation on anyone.

**A year of investment.** Centennial isn't instant—it takes commitment. That's intentional. The people who stay for a year have proven this matters to them.

*A centennial is 100 years—the lifetime of an oak. That's how long your grove can stand.*
