# What is Wisp?

Some people want AI to write for them. Grove isn't for those people.

Wisp is Grove's writing assistant—a tool that helps polish your voice without replacing it. It checks grammar, analyzes tone, suggests word choices, and evaluates readability. What it never does: write content for you, expand your paragraphs, or generate ideas.

Your words. Refined. Not replaced.

## Why Wisp exists

AI writing tools have become controversial for good reason. Many of them are designed to replace human writing entirely. "Generate a blog post about X." "Expand this to 1000 words." "Write an article in my style." The result is content that sounds like everyone else's AI-generated content.

Wisp takes the opposite position. Your voice is sacred. AI should be a proofreader, not a ghostwriter. It catches the typo you missed, suggests a clearer phrasing, points out when a paragraph is hard to follow. But the ideas, the personality, the *you*—that's untouchable.

## How it works

Wisp offers several analysis modes, all opt-in:

**Grammar analysis** — Catches spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, and punctuation issues. Think of it as a careful friend reading your draft.

**Tone analysis** — Tells you how your writing comes across. Formal? Casual? Warm? Dry? Helpful when you're trying to match a specific voice.

**Readability scoring** — Measures how easy your text is to read. Complex sentences get flagged. Jargon gets noted.

**Word choice suggestions** — When a word feels off, Wisp might suggest alternatives. You decide whether to use them.

All features are off by default. You enable what you want. You can turn everything off anytime.

### Fireside Mode

Some writers freeze at the blank page. If that's you, Fireside Mode might help.

Instead of staring at an empty editor, you have a conversation. Wisp asks what you're thinking about. You respond naturally. After a few exchanges, Wisp organizes *your words* into a draft you can edit.

Wisp doesn't add content. It structures what you already said. The fire doesn't tell the story—it creates the space where stories emerge.

Posts created through Fireside include a small marker letting readers know you started with a conversation.

## What this means for you

**Your voice stays yours.** Wisp will never generate content or expand your writing. If you write 200 words, you have 200 words.

**All features are opt-in.** Nothing analyzes your writing unless you ask.

**Privacy first.** Content is processed with zero data retention. Your words don't train any AI models. Everything is deleted immediately after analysis.

**A helper, not a writer.** Wisp appears when you need it and fades when you don't.

*A will-o'-the-wisp in the forest: light, airy, ephemeral. Wisp appears when you need it, offers gentle guidance, and fades when you don't.*
