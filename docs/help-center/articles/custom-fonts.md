# Custom Fonts

Your blog's font shapes how readers experience your words. Grove includes a curated collection of fonts—all available on every paid plan—with no setup required.

## Choosing a font

1. Go to **Admin → Settings**
2. Find the **Typography** section
3. Select your preferred font
4. Click **Save Font Setting**

Changes apply immediately. Refresh any page to see your new font across your entire site.

## Available fonts

Grove includes 10 carefully selected fonts, organized by purpose:

### Default

- **Lexend** — Optimized for reading fluency, based on research into visual reading speed. Grove's default.

### Accessibility fonts

These fonts are designed for specific readability needs:

- **Atkinson Hyperlegible** — Designed by the Braille Institute for low vision readers. Characters are distinct and unambiguous.
- **OpenDyslexic** — Weighted bottoms help letters stay grounded for readers with dyslexia.

### Sans-serif fonts

Clean, modern options:

- **Quicksand** — Light and airy with smooth curves, geometric and friendly
- **Plus Jakarta Sans** — Professional with warmth, balanced and versatile

### Monospace fonts

For code-heavy or technical blogs:

- **IBM Plex Mono** — Clean, highly readable code font with human warmth
- **Cozette** — Bitmap-style programming font with retro terminal aesthetic

### Display and decorative

For personality:

- **Alagard** — Medieval pixel font for fantasy vibes
- **Calistoga** — Warm, casual brush serif for friendly headlines
- **Caveat** — Handwritten, casual feel

## Font recommendations

**For most blogs:** Lexend (the default) works well for general reading. It was designed specifically to improve reading fluency.

**For accessibility:** Atkinson Hyperlegible is excellent for readers with low vision. OpenDyslexic helps readers with dyslexia.

**For technical blogs:** IBM Plex Mono gives a clean, code-friendly aesthetic.

**For creative/artistic blogs:** Caveat, Calistoga, or Alagard add personality.

## Uploading custom fonts (Evergreen)

Rooted Evergreens can upload their own fonts:

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Typography**
2. Click **Upload Custom Font**
3. Select your font file (WOFF2 recommended for best performance)
4. Name your font and save

Once uploaded, your custom font appears in the font selector alongside Grove's built-in options.

**File formats supported:** WOFF2 (preferred), WOFF, TTF, OTF

**Legal note:** Make sure you have the right to use any font you upload. Many fonts require licenses for web use.

## How fonts are loaded

All fonts are hosted on Grove's CDN and loaded efficiently. Your readers don't need to download anything—fonts load automatically with your pages.

We use modern font loading techniques to avoid layout shifts. Text appears immediately in a fallback font, then smoothly transitions to your chosen font once it's loaded.
