# What is Solarpunk?

You might have seen the word "solarpunk" around Grove. On the Workshop page, in our legal documents, woven through how we talk about what we're building. Here's what it means to us.

## The short version

Solarpunk is a vision of the future that's optimistic without being naive. Technology in service of people, not the other way around. Community ownership over corporate extraction. Building things that last, not things that lock you in.

## Where it comes from

Solarpunk emerged as a counterpoint to dystopian futures. Cyberpunk gave us neon-lit corporate hellscapes. Solarpunk asks: what if we built something better instead?

The aesthetic often involves greenery growing through architecture, solar panels on every roof, communities that actually function. But the philosophy runs deeper than the visuals. It's about believing we can create technology that serves human flourishing.

## What it means for Grove

Grove is solarpunk-aligned. That's not marketing language. It shapes our decisions.

**Community over extraction.** We're not venture-funded. There's no pressure to "grow at all costs" or squeeze value from users. Grove exists to help friends have their own space online.

**Decentralized by design.** Your blog lives on your subdomain. Your data is portable. If Grove disappeared tomorrow, you'd still have your words in standard formats. We don't hold your content hostage.

**Sustainable technology.** We use Cloudflare's global network, which runs on renewable energy. Our ephemeral infrastructure pattern (Firefly) spins servers down when not in use. We think about energy costs, not just dollar costs.

**Building to last.** Our Centennial program promises to keep sites online for 100 years. That's solarpunk thinking: create things that persist beyond quarterly earnings cycles.

**Privacy as default.** We don't track you across the web. We don't sell your data. Our analytics (Rings) are privacy-first. Our AI features use zero data retention. Your words stay yours.

## What it looks like in practice

When we're deciding how to build something, solarpunk alignment means asking:

- Does this give Wanderers more control, or less?
- Does this create lock-in, or freedom?
- Does this serve people, or extract from them?
- Will this still work in 10 years? 50?

Sometimes the solarpunk answer is slower or more expensive. We build it anyway.

## The bigger picture

The internet was supposed to be a garden. Somewhere along the way, it became a mall. Algorithmic feeds optimized for engagement. Platforms that own your content. Surveillance as the default business model.

Solarpunk says we can grow something different. Not by going backwards, but by building forward with intention. Technology that helps you connect without exploiting you. Infrastructure that serves communities instead of corporations.

Grove is one small piece of that vision. A quiet corner of the web where your words can grow, where you own what you create, where the business model is "charge fair prices" instead of selling your data.
