# What are Rings?

Count the rings of a tree and you learn its story.

Rings is Grove's analytics system—private insights for writers, not public metrics for vanity. See how your posts perform, understand what resonates, track your growth over time. But never in real-time. Never compared to others. Never designed to make you anxious.

## Why Rings exists

Traditional analytics are designed for marketers. Real-time dashboards. Constant refresh-checking. "Your views are down 20% this week!" Notifications that pull you back when you should be writing.

That's not what writers need. Writers need to know if their work is finding readers. They need to understand what resonates and what doesn't. They need motivation to keep going, not anxiety about metrics they can't control.

Rings takes a wellness-first approach. All stats are delayed 24 hours—no dopamine hits from watching numbers climb. Nothing compares you to other writers. Silence is neutral, not failure. The goal is insight without obsession.

## How it works

Rings provides several kinds of information:

**Aggregate stats** — Page views, unique readers, popular posts. Big-picture understanding of your blog's reach.

**Resonance indicators** — Instead of vote counts, you see signals like "Sparked Interest" (above your average) or "Really Resonated" (your top 25%). These compare you only to yourself.

**Reading patterns** — Which posts get read all the way through? Which get abandoned halfway? This tells you what truly connects.

**Geographic overview** — Where in the world are your readers? (No individual tracking—just country-level aggregates.)

All of this is private. No public view counts. No leaderboards. No one sees your numbers but you.

### Delayed by Design

Rings doesn't show real-time data. Everything is delayed 24 hours. This is intentional:

- No refresh-checking compulsion
- Focus on writing, not watching
- Data reflects settled patterns, not momentary spikes

### Focus Periods

Need to step away from analytics entirely? Focus Periods let you hide your stats for a week, a month, or indefinitely. When you're deep in a project, metrics can wait.

**Note:** Rings is currently being built and will be available to Sapling tier and above.

## What this means for you

**Insight without anxiety.** Learn what works without developing a metrics addiction.

**Privacy by default.** Your stats are yours alone. No public displays.

**Wellness first.** Every feature is designed around the question: "Does this help writers, or does this exploit them?"

**Your baseline, not theirs.** Resonance indicators compare you to your own history, never to other writers.

*Rings are internal. Private. You only see them when you look closely at your own tree. That's what good analytics should be.*
