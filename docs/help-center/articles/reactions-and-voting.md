# Reactions and Voting in Meadow

Meadow has two ways to engage with posts: voting and emoji reactions. Here's how they work.

## Voting

Every post in Meadow can be upvoted or downvoted. This affects how posts are ranked in the feed, but there's no public score display—you won't see "+47" next to a post.

**To vote:**
- Click ▲ to upvote (you found this valuable)
- Click ▼ to downvote (you didn't)
- Click again to remove your vote

**What voting does:**
- Upvotes push posts higher in "Popular" and "Hot" feeds
- Downvotes push posts lower
- Votes are private—no one can see how you voted
- You can't vote on your own posts

**Feed sorting options:**
- **Newest** — Most recent posts first, no voting influence
- **Popular** — Highest net score (upvotes minus downvotes)
- **Hot** — Recent posts that are getting upvotes
- **Top** — Best posts by time period (today, week, month, year, all-time)

Voting is about collective curation, not competition. Good posts rise; less relevant ones fade.

## Emoji reactions

Reactions let you respond to posts with more nuance than an upvote. When you react to a post, your emoji appears alongside others who reacted the same way.

**Standard emojis:**
- ❤️ (love)
- 😂 (funny)
- 😮 (surprised)
- 😢 (sad)
- 😡 (angry)

**Combination emojis:** Grove also has over 100 "emoji kitchen" combinations—creative mashups like ❤️‍🔥 or 🥹. These let you express reactions that don't fit the standard five.

**How reactions display:**
- The top 5 most-used reactions show on each post
- More popular reactions appear larger
- You can add multiple different reactions to the same post

## Voting vs. reactions

They're different tools:

**Voting** is about ranking. It helps the community surface good posts. It's private and functional.

**Reactions** are about expression. They're visible and social. They let you say "this made me laugh" or "this hit hard" without writing a comment.

You can do both on the same post. Upvote something valuable *and* react with ❤️ if it resonated.

## Rate limits

To prevent abuse:
- 100 votes per hour
- Reactions aren't limited, but spamming the same emoji gets ignored

These limits are generous enough that you'll never hit them in normal use.

## Who can vote and react?

**Everyone with a Grove account.** Free accounts have full access to voting and reactions in Meadow. You don't need a paid blog plan to participate in the community—just an account.

## Can I see who voted or reacted?

**Voting:** No. Votes are completely private. Authors don't know who upvoted or downvoted their posts.

**Reactions:** The reaction itself is visible (people can see that someone reacted with 😂), but who specifically reacted is not displayed publicly.

## Tips for genuine engagement

Meadow works best when people use it honestly:

- Upvote posts you'd want to see more of
- Downvote posts that don't belong, not posts you simply disagree with
- React when you have a genuine response, not as a performative gesture

The goal isn't to game a system or build a following. It's to help good writing find readers.
