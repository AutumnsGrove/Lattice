# Exporting Your Content

Everything you write on Grove belongs to you. Here's how to get a complete copy of your data.

## How to export

1. Go to **Settings → Data** in your admin panel
2. Click **Export Data**
3. Wait a moment while we package everything
4. Download the ZIP file

Your export includes everything: posts, comments, media, and settings.

## What's in the export

Your download is a ZIP file organized like this:

```
grove-export-yourusername-2025-01-15.zip
├── posts/
│   ├── 2025-01-15-my-first-post.md
│   ├── 2025-02-20-another-post.md
│   └── ...
├── comments/
│   ├── comments.json
│   └── replies.json
├── media/
│   └── (your uploaded images)
├── config/
│   └── site-settings.json
└── README.md
```

**Posts** are in Markdown format—the same format many other blogging platforms use. You can open them in any text editor or import them elsewhere.

**Comments** are in JSON format, including the author name, content, timestamp, and which post they belong to. Both public comments and private replies are included.

**Media** includes all images and files you've uploaded. Same filenames, same organization.

**Settings** captures your blog configuration: title, description, theme choices, and preferences.

## Standard formats only

We use formats that work everywhere:

- **Markdown** for posts (plain text, portable)
- **JSON** for structured data (comments, settings)
- **Original formats** for media (JPG, PNG, etc.)

No proprietary formats, no lock-in. Your content works outside of Grove.

## When you might want to export

**Regular backups.** Even though we back up your data, having your own copy is smart. Export every few months if it gives you peace of mind.

**Moving to another platform.** If Grove stops being the right fit, your export has everything you need. Most blogging platforms can import Markdown files.

**Archiving.** If you're winding down a blog but want to keep the content, export gives you a permanent local copy.

## If you're leaving Grove

We believe your data should never be held hostage. When you cancel:

- Export is available immediately through your admin panel
- We'll also email you a download link within 24 hours
- Your data stays available for 90 days after cancellation
- After 90 days, it's permanently deleted from our servers

No transfer fees. No artificial delays. No "pay to keep your data" schemes.

## What about my domain?

If you're on Evergreen with a domain included:

- The domain is registered in your name—you own it
- Request a transfer authorization code anytime
- We provide it within 48 hours
- No transfer fees from our side

Your domain goes where you go.
