# Upgrading or Downgrading Your Plan

You can change your Grove plan anytime. Here's how it works.

## How to change your plan

1. Go to **Settings → Plan** in your admin panel
2. You'll see your current plan and available options
3. Click **Change Plan**
4. Select your new plan
5. Confirm the change

That's it. No hoops, no retention flows, no "are you sure?" five times.

## When you upgrade

**Immediate access.** The moment you upgrade, you get access to all features of your new plan. More posts, more storage, new themes—available right away.

**Prorated billing.** You only pay the difference for the remainder of your billing cycle. If you're halfway through a month on Seedling ($8) and upgrade to Sapling ($12), you'll pay roughly $2 now for the rest of this month, then $12 starting next cycle.

**What unlocks by plan:**

| Upgrade to | You gain |
|------------|----------|
| Seedling → Sapling | 200 more posts, 4 GB storage, 7 themes, email forwarding |
| Sapling → Oak | Unlimited posts, 15 GB storage, theme customizer, custom domain |
| Oak → Evergreen | 80 GB more storage, custom fonts, included domain, support hours |

## When you downgrade

**Keep access until period ends.** When you downgrade, you keep your current plan's features until the end of your billing period. If you downgrade on day 10 of your month, you have 20 more days of your current plan.

**Your content stays.** If you're over the new plan's limits, your existing content isn't deleted. You just can't publish new posts until you're under the limit.

**Example:** You have 100 posts on Sapling (250 limit) and downgrade to Seedling (50 limit). All 100 posts remain published and visible. You just can't create post #101 until you delete or unpublish some.

**Features revert.** When the billing period ends:
- Theme customizer settings revert to defaults (if downgrading from Oak)
- Custom domain stops working (if downgrading from Oak)
- Some fonts become unavailable

## What happens to my data?

Nothing bad.

- **Posts**: Stay published, stay accessible
- **Images**: Remain in your media library
- **Settings**: Preserved (though some options may become unavailable)
- **Custom domain**: Stops resolving to your blog (but the domain is still yours)

You never lose content because of a plan change.

## Timing considerations

**Upgrades:** Take effect immediately. Good for when you need a feature right now.

**Downgrades:** Take effect at the end of your current billing period. You're already paid up—might as well use what you've got.

**Tip:** If you're approaching your post limit on Seedling and not sure if you want to commit to Sapling, you can always upgrade for a month, see how it feels, and downgrade later. Your posts stay either way.

## If you're on Free

Free accounts can browse Meadow and comment on posts, but can't publish a blog. To start blogging, upgrade to Seedling or above.

The upgrade path: **Free → Seedling → Sapling → Oak → Evergreen**

You can jump to any paid tier directly—you don't have to go through them in order.

## Payment method

Plan changes use your existing payment method on file. If your card has expired or been replaced, you'll be prompted to update it before the change processes.

## Refunds on downgrades

Downgrades don't trigger refunds for the current period. You keep access to your current plan until the period ends, then move to the lower tier. If you need a refund for other reasons, see our [refund policy](/knowledge/legal/refund-policy).
