# Upgrading or Downgrading Your Plan

You can change your Grove plan anytime. Here's how it works.

## How to change your plan

1. Go to **Account** in your admin panel
2. You'll see your current plan and available options under "Your Plan"
3. Click **Change Plan**
4. Select your new plan
5. Confirm the change

That's it. No hoops, no retention flows, no "are you sure?" five times.

## When you upgrade

**Immediate access.** The moment you upgrade, you get access to all features of your new plan. More posts, more storage, new themes—available right away.

**Prorated billing.** You only pay the difference for the remainder of your billing cycle. If you're halfway through a month on Seedling ($8) and upgrade to Sapling ($12), you'll pay roughly $2 now for the rest of this month, then $12 starting next cycle.

**What unlocks by plan:**

| Upgrade to          | You gain                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wanderer → Seedling | 75 more posts, ~900 MB more storage, Meadow sharing, unlimited comments, no ads guarantee                        |
| Seedling → Sapling  | Unlimited posts, 4 GB storage, 7 more curated themes (coming soon), email forwarding, Centennial eligibility     |
| Sapling → Oak       | 15 GB more storage, theme customizer (coming soon), custom domain, Analytics                                     |
| Oak → Evergreen     | 80 GB more storage, custom font uploads (coming soon), domain included (we register it), dedicated support hours |

## When you downgrade

**Keep access until period ends.** When you downgrade, you keep your current plan's features until the end of your billing period. If you downgrade on day 10 of your month, you have 20 more days of your current plan.

**Your content stays.** If you're over the new plan's limits, your existing content isn't deleted. You just can't publish new posts until you're under the limit.

**Example:** You have 150 posts on Sapling (unlimited) and downgrade to Seedling (100 limit). All 150 posts remain published and visible. You just can't create post #151 until you delete or unpublish some.

**Features revert.** When the billing period ends:

- Theme customizer settings revert to defaults (if downgrading from Oak/Evergreen)
- Custom domain stops working (if downgrading from Oak/Evergreen)
- Some curated themes become unavailable (if downgrading to Seedling's 3 themes)
- Analytics access is removed (if downgrading from Oak/Evergreen)

## What happens to my data?

Nothing bad.

- **Posts**: Stay published, stay accessible
- **Images**: Remain in your media library
- **Settings**: Preserved (though some options may become unavailable)
- **Custom domain**: Stops resolving to your blog (but the domain is still yours)

You never lose content because of a plan change.

## Timing considerations

**Upgrades:** Take effect immediately. Good for when you need a feature right now.

**Downgrades:** Take effect at the end of your current billing period. You're already paid up—might as well use what you've got.

**Tip:** If you're approaching your post limit on Seedling and not sure if you want to commit to Sapling, you can always upgrade for a month, see how it feels, and downgrade later. Your posts stay either way.

## If you're on Wanderer

Wanderer is your free starting point — 25 posts, 100 MB storage, your own grove.place address. When you're ready for more room, cultivate to any paid tier.

The growth path: **Wanderer → Seedling → Sapling → Oak → Evergreen**

You can jump to any tier directly — you don't have to go through them in order.

## Payment method

Plan changes use your existing payment method on file. If your card has expired or been replaced, you'll be prompted to update it before the change processes.

## Refunds on downgrades

Downgrades don't trigger refunds for the current period. You keep access to your current plan until the period ends, then move to the lower tier. If you need a refund for other reasons, see our [[refund policy]].
