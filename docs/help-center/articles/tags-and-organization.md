# Tags and Organization

Tags help you organize your posts into topics. Here's how they work and when they're useful.

## Adding tags to a post

When you're editing a post in the admin panel:

1. Look for the **Tags** field below the main editor
2. Enter your tags, separated by commas
3. Save or publish your post

That's it. Your tags are attached to the post.

**Example:** If you write about cooking, travel, and personal updates, you might use tags like `recipes`, `travel`, `life`. A post about making pasta on vacation could get both `recipes` and `travel`.

## How to think about tags

Tags work best when you're consistent. A few guidelines:

**Keep them simple.** `photography` works better than `my-photography-hobby`. Readers and future-you will thank you.

**Use lowercase.** `writing` and `Writing` are the same to Grove, but consistency helps you stay organized.

**Don't overdo it.** Three to five tags per post is usually plenty. If everything is tagged with everything, tags stop being useful.

**Think about what you'd search for.** If you wanted to find this post later, what word would you type?

## Where tags appear

Tags show up in a few places:

- **On your post** — Displayed with the post metadata so readers can see the topic
- **In your RSS feed** — Subscribers' feed readers can filter by tag
- **In Meadow** — If you share posts to the community feed, you can filter which tags go to Meadow

## Organizing with intention

You don't need a complex system. Some bloggers use just two or three tags across their whole blog. Others use more. What matters is that it helps you—and your readers—find things.

A few patterns that work:

**By topic:** `tech`, `books`, `personal`, `work`

**By format:** `essay`, `photo`, `link`, `update`

**By series:** `monthly-review`, `project-name`, `travel-2025`

Pick what makes sense for how you write.

## Changing tags later

You can edit tags on any post anytime:

1. Go to **Posts** in your admin panel
2. Click on the post you want to edit
3. Update the tags field
4. Save

Your changes take effect immediately.

## What tags don't do (yet)

A few things to know:

- **No tag pages yet.** You can't click a tag and see all posts with that tag. This is on our roadmap.
- **No tag suggestions.** You'll need to remember your own tags or keep them simple enough that consistency is easy.
- **No limits.** You can add as many tags as you want, but more isn't better.
