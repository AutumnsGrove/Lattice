# Grove's Vision

The internet used to be a place of personal expression. Geocities. Angelfire. Blogs with personality. Somewhere along the way, we traded that for algorithms, engagement metrics, and platforms that own our words.

Grove is a return to something simpler.

## What we believe

### Your words are yours

Not a platform's. Not a dataset. Not training material for AI models. When you write on Grove, you own what you create. You can export it anytime. You can leave anytime. Your content comes with you.

### Readers matter

Every Grove blog is publicly accessible by default. No login walls. No "sign up to read more." Just visit and read. The open web, as it should be.

### Privacy isn't a premium feature

We don't track your readers. No analytics scripts following people around the web. No selling data to advertisers. When someone reads your blog and leaves, that's it. They're gone.

### Simplicity is a feature

Write in Markdown. Upload images. Publish. That's it. No plugin ecosystems, no endless settings, no feature bloat competing for your attention. The technology should disappear into the background.

### Community can exist without competition

[[meadow|Meadow]] (our optional community feed) doesn't display follower counts. Reactions are private—encouragement for the author, not performance for an audience. No algorithms deciding who gets amplified. Just chronological posts from people you follow.

## What we're building against

The major platforms have trained us to measure ourselves by engagement. Likes, shares, follower counts. Algorithms that reward outrage because outrage gets clicks.

Grove doesn't have public metrics. We don't have an algorithm boosting "engaging" content. We don't notify you when someone unfollows you. These aren't missing features—they're intentional absences.

## AI and your writing

Your words are not training data.

Every major AI company sends crawlers across the web to feed their models. Grove blocks them all. GPTBot, CCBot, Google-Extended, anthropic-ai—they hit a wall. Your writing stays between you and your readers.

We do use AI internally, but carefully: for content moderation with zero data retention, through providers who don't train on your content. There's a difference between using a tool responsibly and feeding a machine indiscriminately.

## Who this is for

Grove works for people who want:

- A personal space online, without wrestling with complex software
- Ownership of their words, not just permission to post
- Privacy for their readers, not surveillance
- Community without competition
- Something calmer than social media

Grove probably isn't for people who need e-commerce, complex membership tiers, or infinite customization. We're intentionally focused.

## The metaphor

A [[grove|grove]] is a small group of trees. Each tree is independent—complete on its own. But beneath the surface, [[rooted|roots]] intermingle. Trees share nutrients through [[mycelium|mycorrhizal networks]]. The oldest trees nurture the saplings.

That's what we're building. A forest of voices. A place where people can [[plant]] their thoughts and watch them grow.

## Why this matters

The web is being scraped into datasets. Authentic human spaces are getting rarer. Platforms optimize for engagement, not wellbeing. Algorithms decide what you see.

Grove is one small corner where things work differently. A refuge from the noise. A place to write for the sake of writing, and to read for the sake of reading.

## Where This Comes From

These aren't abstract principles. They come from somewhere real.

Before [[grove|Grove]] existed, I had a backyard with a hammock and a [[your-garden|garden]]. A front [[porch|porch]] where I watched sunrises. Birds I knew by song. Friends who came over just to exist together. My days had texture.

Then I lost it all. And in the numbness that followed, I started building a place where people could plant their own little sanctuaries, tend their own corners of the internet, and find some of that texture again.

[[grove|Grove]] is a refuge because I needed one. I'm building a [[grove|grove]] for people who lost their [[your-grove|groves]].
