# What is Grove?

Grove is a blogging platform for people who want their own space on the internet—without the complexity of self-hosting or the tradeoffs of big tech platforms.

## The short version

You get a blog. It's yours. You write, we host it, your readers can find you via your own URL. No ads, no algorithms deciding who sees your posts, no tracking your visitors.

## What makes Grove different

**You own your content.** Everything you write belongs to you. You can export it anytime, in standard formats that work anywhere. If you ever leave, your words come with you.

**Privacy by default.** We don't track your readers. No analytics scripts following people around the web. Your visitors' attention is between them and your words.

**Simple on purpose.** Grove has what you need to write and publish. It doesn't have a hundred features you'll never use. The admin panel is clean, the writing experience is focused, and you can be up and running in minutes.

**Real support from real people.** When you reach out, you're talking to an actual human. Usually Autumn, who built this thing. We read every message and respond within a day.

## Who is Grove for?

Grove works well for:

- **Personal bloggers** who want a home for their thoughts without wrestling with WordPress or paying for features they don't need
- **Writers** who want to focus on writing, not configuring
- **People leaving big platforms** who want ownership of their work and respect for their readers' privacy
- **Anyone who misses the old web**—when having a blog felt personal, not performative

## What Grove isn't

Grove isn't trying to be everything. It's not a social network, a newsletter platform, or a business website builder. It's a place to write and share your writing with people who want to read it.

If you need e-commerce, complex membership tiers, or a design tool with infinite customization, Grove probably isn't the right fit. If you want a simple, honest blog that just works—welcome.

## Pricing

Grove has a few plans, starting with **Seedling** (free, with limits) up through paid tiers that unlock more posts, storage, and features. We're transparent about what each plan includes—no hidden fees, no bait-and-switch.

See current pricing at [grove.place/pricing](/pricing).

## The values behind it

Grove is built on a few principles:

- **Your data belongs to you.** Full stop.
- **Privacy isn't a premium feature.** Everyone deserves it.
- **Simple tools can be powerful.** Constraints are features.
- **The internet should have more weird, personal, authentic corners.** Grove is one of them.
