# Understanding Your Privacy

Privacy isn't a feature we bolt on at the end. It's built into how Grove works from the ground up.

Here's what that actually means for you.

## Your data as a blogger

**We collect what we need, nothing more.**

When you sign up, we store:
- Your email address (to log you in and contact you)
- Your blog content (so we can display it)
- Your settings and preferences (so your blog works the way you want)

That's the core of it. We're not building a profile on you. We're not tracking your behavior to serve you ads. We're hosting your blog.

**You can see everything we have.**

In your admin panel under **Settings → Data**, you can export a complete copy of everything Grove stores about you. It's your data—you should be able to look at it.

**You can take it and leave.**

Export comes in standard formats (JSON, Markdown). If you decide to move to another platform, your writing comes with you. We don't hold your content hostage.

## Your readers' privacy

This is where Grove is different from most platforms.

**We don't track your visitors.**

There are no analytics scripts following your readers around the web. No cookies tracking them across sites. No fingerprinting. When someone reads your blog and leaves, that's it—they're gone.

**IP addresses are kept for one minute.**

We need IP addresses briefly for rate limiting (preventing abuse). After 60 seconds, they're discarded. We don't log them, store them, or use them to identify anyone.

**Here's what our data retention looks like:**

| Data Type | Retention |
|-----------|-----------|
| IP addresses | 60 seconds |
| Error logs | 7 days |
| Your blog content | Until you delete it |
| Account data | Until you close your account |
| Backups | 30 days after deletion |

**No third-party trackers.**

We don't embed Google Analytics, Facebook pixels, or any other tracking scripts. Your readers aren't the product.

## What about analytics?

If you want to know how your blog is doing, Grove offers privacy-respecting analytics on some plans. This means:

- Aggregate data only (page views, not individual visitors)
- No cookies or tracking
- No identifying information stored
- Data stays on Grove's servers, not sent to third parties

You can see trends without surveilling your readers.

## Content moderation and AI

When we review content for safety (like checking for harmful material), we use AI tools with **zero data retention agreements**. This means:

- Your content is processed but never stored by the AI provider
- It's not used to train AI models
- It's analyzed and forgotten

We chose providers specifically because they offer these guarantees.

## What we'll never do

Some things Grove will never do, full stop:

- **Sell your data.** Not to advertisers, not to data brokers, not to anyone.
- **Use your content to train AI.** Your writing is yours, not training data.
- **Share your information without your consent.** Unless legally compelled (and we'll fight that where possible).
- **Track your readers.** Their privacy matters too.

## If you have questions

Privacy can feel abstract until you have a specific concern. If you're wondering "does Grove do X with my data?" or "can anyone see Y?"—just ask.

Reply to any email from us, or use the support form. We'll give you a straight answer.
