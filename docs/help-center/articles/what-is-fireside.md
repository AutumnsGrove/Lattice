# What is Fireside?

Some people have no trouble talking. In group chats, over coffee, explaining something to a friend. The ideas flow. The voice is there. But sit them in front of a blank page and everything locks up. "What do I write? Where do I start?"

Fireside is for those moments.

## The short version

Fireside is a conversational drafting mode inside [[flow|Flow]], Grove's editor. Instead of staring at an empty page, you have a conversation with [[wisp|Wisp]]. It asks what's on your mind. You answer naturally. After a few exchanges, Wisp organizes *your words* into a draft you can edit.

The fire doesn't tell the story. It creates the space where stories emerge.

## How it works

Open a new post in Flow and choose "Start with a conversation." Wisp greets you with a question. Something open-ended, like "What's been living in your head lately?" or "What surprised you this week?"

You respond. Type like you're texting a friend. Don't worry about structure or polish. Just say what you're thinking.

Wisp asks follow-up questions. "What draws you to that?" or "Tell me more about that last part." The conversation continues as long as you want.

When you feel ready, click "Ready to draft." Wisp takes everything you said and organizes it into a coherent post. Your words, your ideas, your voice. Wisp just arranged them.

Review the draft. Edit it. Add to it. Delete parts. It's yours now. When it feels right, publish.

## What Fireside isn't

Fireside has clear boundaries.

**Wisp organizes. It doesn't generate.** If you give brief answers, you get a brief draft. Wisp won't pad your thoughts into something longer. You get out what you put in.

**Wisp listens. It doesn't contribute.** No new ideas appear that you didn't express. No opinions you didn't share. Wisp might smooth a transition or suggest you elaborate, but it never adds content.

**Wisp asks questions. It doesn't write for you.** If you ask Wisp to "write me a post about X," it'll redirect you back to conversation. "I can't write for you, but I'd love to hear what you think about X. What draws you to it?"

This is intentional. Grove believes your voice is sacred. AI should help you express yourself, not express itself on your behalf.

## The transparency marker

Every post created through Fireside includes a small attribution at the end:

*~ written fireside with Wisp ~*

This marker is permanent. It's enforced at the API level, not just in the editor. You can't remove it by editing the post.

Why? Honesty matters. Readers deserve to know when AI helped shape a piece of writing. The marker acknowledges the process while making clear that the words are yours. Wisp organized your thoughts. It didn't replace them.

## What this means for you

**If you freeze at blank pages:** Fireside might help. Having a conversation is easier than writing from scratch. Your words are already there. Fireside just helps you find them.

**If you're curious about the process:** The draft shows you what you said, reorganized. You can see exactly where each piece came from. Nothing mysterious, nothing hidden.

**If transparency matters to you:** The marker stays. Anyone reading your post will know you started with a conversation. That's the deal.
