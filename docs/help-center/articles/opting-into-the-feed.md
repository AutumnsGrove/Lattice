# Sharing Posts to Meadow

Meadow is Grove's community feed—a place where blog posts from across Grove can be discovered, upvoted, and discussed. Sharing your posts there is entirely optional.

## How it works

By default, your blog is private. Your posts live at your URL and that's it. People find them through your link, through search engines, or through your RSS feed.

When you enable Meadow sharing, your published posts can appear in the community feed. Other Grove users can discover your writing, vote on it, and react with emojis. It's a way to find readers who might never have stumbled across your blog otherwise.

## Enabling Meadow sharing

1. Go to **Settings → Meadow** in your admin panel
2. Toggle **Share my posts on Grove feed** to on
3. Save your settings

That's the basic setup. New posts you publish will now appear in Meadow.

## Choosing what gets shared

You don't have to share everything. Use tag filtering to control which posts go to Meadow:

1. In **Settings → Meadow**, look for **Tag filter**
2. Enter the tags you want to share (e.g., `public`, `essays`)
3. Save

Now only posts with those tags appear in Meadow. Personal updates, drafts-you-published-anyway, or anything you'd rather keep quieter stays on your blog only.

**Example:** You might tag most posts normally, but add a `meadow` tag specifically to posts you want in the community feed.

## What happens when you share

When one of your posts appears in Meadow:

- **It shows up in the feed.** Other users browsing Meadow might see it, depending on how they've sorted (newest, popular, etc.)
- **People can vote.** Upvotes and downvotes affect where your post appears in rankings, but vote counts aren't displayed publicly.
- **People can react.** Emoji reactions show community engagement. The top reactions appear on your post in the feed.
- **People can reply.** Meadow comments are separate from your blog's comment section.

## Turning it off

Changed your mind? No problem.

1. Go to **Settings → Meadow**
2. Toggle **Share my posts on Grove feed** to off
3. Save

Posts already in Meadow will be removed from the feed. Your blog continues as normal—it just stops appearing in the community space.

## Who can use Meadow

**Free accounts** can browse Meadow, vote on posts, react with emojis, and leave replies. But to share your own posts to the feed, you need a paid blog tier (Seedling or above).

**All paid tiers** can share posts to Meadow. There's no extra cost—it's included.

## A note on discoverability

Meadow isn't trying to be social media. There are no follower counts, no viral mechanics designed to monopolize attention. It's more like a community bulletin board: people share what they've written, others can find it, and everyone moves on with their day.

If you want readers beyond your existing audience, Meadow can help. If you prefer your blog to be a quieter corner of the internet, that's fine too. Your call.
