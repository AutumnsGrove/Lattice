# What is Arbor?

Behind every Grove blog is a quiet workspace. A place where posts get written, images get uploaded, and settings get adjusted. That's Arbor.

Arbor is your admin panel—the control center for your blog. Visit `yourblog.grove.place/admin` and you'll find everything you need to manage your corner of the grove. Simple, focused, and designed to get out of the way so you can write.

## Why Arbor exists

Many blogging platforms bury you in dashboards. Analytics graphs competing for attention. SEO scores demanding optimization. Notifications about engagement metrics you didn't ask for. The admin panel becomes a source of anxiety instead of a tool for creation.

Arbor takes a different philosophy: **show what's needed, hide what isn't.**

You came here to write. Arbor helps you do that and then steps aside.

## How it works

When you log in to your admin panel, you land on a simple dashboard. No real-time visitor counts staring back at you. Just a quick health check (is everything working?), a few shortcut buttons, and your recent posts.

The sidebar gives you what you need:

**Blog Posts** — Write new posts, edit existing ones, manage drafts. This is where most of your time goes.

**Pages** — Static pages like About, Contact, or anything else that isn't a dated blog post.

**Images** — Upload images directly to your media library. Drag and drop, paste from clipboard, or select files. Get a URL you can use anywhere.

**Settings** — Site title, description, social links, appearance. The knobs you occasionally need to adjust.

Everything saves automatically. Everything loads quickly. Mobile works as well as desktop.

## What this means for you

**Your writing space, not a metrics dashboard.** Arbor won't show you visitor graphs or engagement scores. If you want analytics, they're available elsewhere (see [[rings|Rings]]). The admin panel stays focused on creation.

**Fast and simple.** No page reloads when switching sections. No waiting for bloated dashboards to render. Arbor is lightweight by design.

**Works on your phone.** Forgot to publish something? Spotted a typo? You can fix it from your phone just as easily as from your laptop.

**One place for everything.** Posts, pages, images, settings—all in one panel. No hunting through separate apps or services.
