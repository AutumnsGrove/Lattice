# Choosing Your Plan

**First, the important bit:** Reading Grove blogs is free. Always. Every blog is publicly accessible. Just visit and read, no account needed. You only need a plan if you want to _write_ your own blog.

Grove has a few plans, each designed for different needs. Here's what you get at each level.

## The plans

### Wanderer

**$0/month**: Your first steps in the grove.

A quiet clearing to try your hand at writing — no credit card, no commitment. Wanderer is a real blog, not just community access. You get your own grove.place address and everything you need to start.

- Up to 25 blog posts
- 100 MB storage for images
- Your own grove.place address
- RSS feed
- [[meadow]] access for browsing and reacting
- No credit card needed

### Seedling

**$8/month**: Your first blog.

Everything you need to start writing. No feature walls, no "upgrade to unlock basic functionality." Seedling is a real plan.

- Up to 100 posts
- 1 GB storage for images and media
- All 10 fonts + accent color customization
- 3 curated themes (coming soon)
- Unlimited comments on your blog
- RSS feed
- Share posts to Meadow

### Sapling (coming soon)

**$12/month**: For regular bloggers.

More room to grow. If you're posting frequently or building up an archive, Sapling gives you space.

- Unlimited posts
- 5 GB storage
- All 10 fonts + accent color
- All 10 curated themes (coming soon)
- Email forwarding (`you@grove.place`)
- **Centennial eligible** — after 12 months, your site stays online for 100 years
- Everything in Seedling

### Oak (coming soon)

**$25/month**: Full control.

Bring your own domain. Customize your theme fully. This is for bloggers who want their site to feel completely their own.

- Unlimited posts
- 20 GB storage
- All 10 fonts + accent color
- All 10 curated themes + theme customizer (coming soon)
- Custom domain support (bring your own domain)

### Evergreen (coming soon)

**$35/month**: The complete package.

Everything Grove offers, including a domain on us.

- 100 GB storage
- All 10 fonts + custom font uploads (coming soon)
- All 10 curated themes + theme customizer (coming soon)
- Domain included (we register it for you)
- Analytics
- 8 hours/month dedicated support

## How to think about it

**Just curious?** Start with Wanderer — it's free, no credit card needed. Twenty-five posts, your own address, a real blog.

**Posting regularly?** Sapling's unlimited posts and extra storage handles most active blogs comfortably.

**Want a custom domain?** That's Oak territory. Bring a domain you already own, or upgrade to Evergreen and we'll register one for you.

**Not sure?** Start with Wanderer for free. When you're ready for more room, cultivate to Seedling. Your content comes with you.

## Changing plans

You can upgrade or downgrade anytime from **Settings → Plan**.

When you upgrade, you get immediate access to new features. When you downgrade, you keep access through the end of your current billing period.

If you're over the limits of your new plan (say, you have 150 posts and downgrade to Seedling's 100), your existing content stays. You just can't publish new posts until you're under the limit.

## Centennial: Your grove can outlive you

On Sapling and above, after 12 cumulative months of being rooted, your grove earns **Centennial status**. Your site stays online for 100 years from the day you planted it—even if you stop paying someday.

A hundred years is roughly how long an oak tree lives. Some trees outlive the people who planted them. Yours can too.

You can opt out anytime if you'd rather your site not persist. But we think your words are worth keeping.

## No hidden fees

The price listed is the price you pay. No setup fees, no surprise charges, no "actually it's more if you want X."

All plans include:

- SSL certificate (your site is secure)
- Cloudflare CDN (your site loads fast)
- Daily backups (your content is safe)
- Email support (real humans respond)
