# Choosing Your Plan

**First, the important bit:** Reading Grove blogs is free. Always. Every blog is publicly accessible. Just visit and read, no account needed. You only need a plan if you want to *write* your own blog.

Grove has a few plans, each designed for different needs. Here's what you get at each level.

## The plans

### Free

**$0/month**: Browse Meadow, comment on posts, explore the community.

This isn't a blog plan. You can't publish posts on Free. But you can participate in Meadow: upvote posts, leave reactions, reply to others. It's a way to be part of Grove without running a blog yourself.

- Access to Meadow community feed
- 20 public comments per week on other blogs
- Unlimited private replies to authors

### Seedling

**$8/month**: Your first blog.

Everything you need to start writing. No feature walls, no "upgrade to unlock basic functionality." Seedling is a real plan.

- Up to 50 posts
- 1 GB storage for images and media
- All 10 fonts + accent color customization
- 3 curated themes (coming in Foliage First Buds)
- Unlimited comments on your blog
- RSS feed
- Share posts to Meadow

### Sapling (coming soon)

**$12/month**: For regular bloggers.

More room to grow. If you're posting frequently or building up an archive, Sapling gives you space.

- Up to 250 posts
- 5 GB storage
- All 10 fonts + accent color
- All 10 curated themes (coming in Foliage Full Bloom)
- Email forwarding (`you@grove.place`)
- **Centennial eligible** — after 12 months, your site stays online for 100 years
- Everything in Seedling

### Oak (coming soon)

**$25/month**: Full control.

Bring your own domain. Customize your theme fully. This is for bloggers who want their site to feel completely their own.

- Unlimited posts
- 20 GB storage
- All 10 fonts + accent color
- All 10 curated themes + theme customizer (coming in Foliage Full Bloom)
- Custom domain support (bring your own domain)
- Analytics
- Priority support
- Everything in Sapling

### Evergreen (coming soon)

**$35/month**: The complete package.

Everything Grove offers, including a domain on us.

- Unlimited posts
- 100 GB storage
- All 10 fonts + custom font uploads (coming in Foliage Full Bloom)
- All 10 curated themes + theme customizer (coming in Foliage Full Bloom)
- Domain included (we register it for you)
- Analytics
- 8 hours/month dedicated support
- Everything in Oak

## How to think about it

**Just starting out?** Seedling has everything you need. You can always upgrade later—your content comes with you.

**Posting regularly?** Sapling's 250 post limit and extra storage handles most active blogs comfortably.

**Want a custom domain?** That's Oak territory. Bring a domain you already own, or upgrade to Evergreen and we'll register one for you.

**Not sure?** Start with Seedling. It's not a trial; it's a real plan with real features. See how it fits before committing to more.

## What about the Free tier?

Free accounts can't blog, but they're not second-class citizens. You get full access to Meadow, which means you can discover posts, vote, react, and participate in conversations. If you're here to read and engage rather than write, Free works fine.

## Changing plans

You can upgrade or downgrade anytime from **Settings → Plan**.

When you upgrade, you get immediate access to new features. When you downgrade, you keep access through the end of your current billing period.

If you're over the limits of your new plan (say, you have 100 posts and downgrade to Seedling's 50), your existing content stays. You just can't publish new posts until you're under the limit.

## Centennial: Your grove can outlive you

On Sapling and above, after 12 cumulative months of being rooted, your grove earns **Centennial status**. Your site stays online for 100 years from the day you planted it—even if you stop paying someday.

A hundred years is roughly how long an oak tree lives. Some trees outlive the people who planted them. Yours can too.

You can opt out anytime if you'd rather your site not persist. But we think your words are worth keeping.

## No hidden fees

The price listed is the price you pay. No setup fees, no surprise charges, no "actually it's more if you want X."

All plans include:
- SSL certificate (your site is secure)
- Cloudflare CDN (your site loads fast)
- Daily backups (your content is safe)
- Email support (real humans respond)
