# GDPR and Privacy Rights

Whether you're in Europe, California, or anywhere else, you have rights over your personal data. Here's what Grove collects, why, and what you can do about it.

## Your rights

Under GDPR (Europe), CCPA (California), and similar laws, you have the right to:

### Access your data

You can see everything Grove stores about you:

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Data**
2. Click **Export Data**
3. Download a complete copy

Your export includes posts, comments, images, and account settings. Everything we have.

### Correct your data

If something's wrong, you can fix it:

- **Email address** — Update via Settings
- **Blog content** — Edit directly in your admin panel
- **Account details** — Most settings are self-service

For anything you can't change yourself, email us and we'll help.

### Delete your data

You can close your account at any time:

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Account**
2. Click **Delete Account**
3. Confirm the deletion

We'll email you an export link before deletion completes. After 90 days, your data is permanently removed from our servers.

### Data portability

You can take your data elsewhere. Grove exports in standard formats (Markdown, JSON) that work with other platforms. No proprietary lock-in.

### Object to processing

If you believe we're processing your data inappropriately, let us know. We'll review and respond within 30 days.

## What Grove collects

### Account data

When you sign up:
- **Email address** — For login and notifications
- **Authentication tokens** — For secure sign-in via Google OAuth

We don't collect your name unless you choose to display one. We don't require phone numbers, addresses, or government ID.

### Blog content

What you create:
- Posts (text and images)
- Pages
- Comments on your blog
- Site settings and preferences

This is your content. You control it. You can delete it.

### Technical data

To run the service:
- **IP addresses** — Kept for 60 seconds for rate limiting, then discarded
- **Error logs** — Kept for 7 days to fix bugs
- **Session data** — For keeping you logged in

We don't build profiles. We don't track behavior across sessions.

### What we don't collect

- Browsing history
- Location data (beyond what IP briefly reveals)
- Device fingerprints
- Third-party tracking data
- Analytics on your readers (unless you opt into Grove's privacy-respecting analytics)

## Data retention

| Data type | How long we keep it |
|-----------|-------------------|
| IP addresses | 60 seconds |
| Error logs | 7 days |
| Your blog content | Until you delete it |
| Account data | Until you close your account |
| Backups | 30 days after deletion |
| Payment records | 7 years (legal requirement) |

## Third parties

Grove uses a small number of third-party services:

- **Cloudflare** — CDN and security (no persistent tracking)
- **Stripe** — Payment processing (required for subscriptions)
- **Google** — OAuth authentication only
- **AI providers** — Content moderation with zero data retention

We don't sell data to anyone. We don't use advertising networks. We don't share your information except as required to provide the service.

## Content moderation and AI

Grove uses AI for content moderation (checking for harmful content). This is done with:

- **Zero data retention** — Your content is processed and immediately forgotten
- **No training** — Your words aren't used to train AI models
- **Minimal processing** — Only what's necessary for safety

For details, see [Understanding Your Privacy](/knowledge/help/understanding-your-privacy).

## International transfers

Grove is built on Cloudflare's global network. Your data may be processed in different countries as part of normal CDN operation. Cloudflare maintains appropriate safeguards for international data transfers.

## How to exercise your rights

**Self-service** (fastest):
- Export: **Settings → Data → Export**
- Delete: **Settings → Account → Delete Account**
- Correct: Edit your content directly in the admin panel

**Email** (for anything else):
- Contact: [support](/contact)
- Response time: Within 30 days (usually much faster)

## For blog readers

If you've commented on a Grove blog and want your comment removed, contact the blog author directly. Blog authors control their own comment sections.

If you can't reach the author, contact Grove support and we'll help facilitate.

## Questions

If you have questions about your privacy rights or how Grove handles data, reach out. We'll give you a straight answer.

*Privacy law is complex. Our approach is simple: collect what we need, delete what we don't, and give you control over what's yours.*
