# What is Midnight Mode?

Grove has four seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter. And then there's the fifth: Midnight.

Midnight Mode is Grove's night theme—a palette of deep purples, soft roses, and twilight blues. It's not just dark mode with different colors. It's the grove after everyone else has gone to bed, when the fireflies come out and the air feels different.

## Why Midnight Mode exists

Grove started as a queer project. Still is. The fifth season is a nod to that—existing outside the expected cycles, finding beauty in spaces others overlook, being unapologetically something different.

Midnight isn't about hiding from the light. It's about thriving in the dark. Some of the best conversations happen at 2 AM. Some of the most honest writing comes when the world is quiet.

The purple palette also just looks beautiful. Deep violets, rose-gold accents, colors that feel both mysterious and warm. It's not trying to be sleek or corporate. It's trying to feel like magic.

## How it works

Midnight Mode is an easter egg. You won't find it in settings.

**On the landing page**, there's a toggle in the footer. Click it, and the seasons cycle: Spring → Summer → Autumn → Winter → Midnight → Spring...

**On your blog**, Midnight is one of the seasonal options. Enable it through the theme settings if your tier supports it.

When active, the entire color palette shifts:
- Backgrounds become deep purple-blacks
- Accents turn to rose and violet
- Text glows softly against the darkness
- The forest sleeps under a starlit sky

Everything still works exactly the same. It's the same Grove, just wearing a different cloak.

## What this means for you

**A personal touch.** Midnight Mode is for people who prefer their grove after dark. Night owls, insomniacs, anyone who finds peace in the quiet hours.

**Queer-coded by design.** The fifth season is intentional. If that resonates with you, welcome. If it doesn't, the other four seasons are lovely too.

**Fully functional.** This isn't a half-baked dark mode. Every element is designed for readability and warmth in the midnight palette.

**Seasonal continuity.** Midnight respects Grove's other seasonal features. The forests still grow, the animations still breathe, everything just happens under a different sky.
