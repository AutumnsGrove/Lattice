# What is Porch?

Have a seat. We'll figure it out together.

Porch is Grove's support system—not a ticket counter with queue numbers and SLAs, but a front porch where you can sit down and have a conversation. Something not working? Have a question? Just want to say hi? Come up the steps and chat.

## Why Porch exists

Traditional support systems treat you like a ticket. You submit a form, get a number, wait in line, eventually receive a templated response. The whole interaction feels transactional, impersonal, exhausting.

Porch is designed differently. Yes, there's tracking behind the scenes (we need to know who said what). But the experience should feel like talking to someone, not filing paperwork.

The metaphor matters: a porch is where neighbors chat. Where problems get solved over a cup of tea. Where the formality drops and real help happens.

## How it works

Visit [porch.grove.place](https://porch.grove.place) to start a conversation.

**Start a visit** — Tell us what's on your mind. Pick a category (billing, technical, account, or just saying hi), describe what's happening, and submit.

**Get a response** — We'll reply by email. If you have an Ivy account, messages appear there too.

**Continue the conversation** — Reply directly to the email. The conversation stays threaded and coherent.

**Check your history** — Logged-in Wanderers can see their past visits, check status, and add follow-ups.

No ticket numbers in the interface. No "your request has been escalated to tier 2." Just two people on a porch, figuring things out.

**Note:** Porch is currently planned and will launch alongside the support infrastructure.

## What this means for you

**Human support.** You're not talking to a bot (though we might use AI to help categorize requests). There's a person on the other side.

**Conversation, not tickets.** The experience is designed to feel like a conversation, even if there's infrastructure underneath.

**Everything in one place.** Your visit history is saved. You can refer back to past conversations.

**Reach out for anything.** Porch isn't just for problems. Want to say thanks? Have a suggestion? Just want to see what Autumn's up to? The porch is open.
