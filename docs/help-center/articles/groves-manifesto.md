# What I Believe

The internet used to be a garden. Not a manicured one—a wild one. Full of weird little corners and handmade pages. You could stumble onto someone's space and feel like you'd discovered something.

Then the walls went up. Platforms became isolated biospheres. Friends scattered and became unreachable unless you followed them through gates someone else controlled.

Grove is everything that isn't.

## What I reject

### The machines

Dopamine slot machines designed to exploit how our minds work. Algorithms that show you 40,000 strangers instead of your friends. Reels, shorts, infinite scroll—engineered to hijack attention, especially neurodivergent attention.

Platforms that built their empires on our words, then loosened protections for people like us the moment it became profitable.

### The harvesting

AI companies sending crawlers across the web to feed their models without asking. Your words becoming training data. Your voice becoming a statistic.

## What I believe

### Your words are yours

Not locked in a platform's database. Not harvested by AI companies. You can download everything at any point—not just when you leave, but always. Standard formats that work anywhere.

### Intentional simplicity

Text and photos only. That's not a limitation—it's a choice. No algorithms deciding who sees your words. No engagement metrics breeding outrage. No viral mechanics rewarding the loudest voice.

Just people, sharing what matters to them.

### Queer-friendly infrastructure

Safe digital spaces, especially when physical ones feel hostile. Somewhere intentionally welcoming. Somewhere that won't suddenly decide we're not worth protecting.

### The long view

Your words could outlive you. With Centennial status, your grove stays online for a hundred years—even after you're gone, if you want it to.

*A hundred years is roughly how long an oak tree lives.*

### Building slowly

I'm building this without venture capital pressure to enshittify. Grove is a forest, not a factory. I grow at the pace of roots.

*This is [solarpunk](/knowledge/help/what-is-solarpunk) thinking.*

## The feeling I'm building toward

When someone signs up for Grove, I want them to feel empowered. Like they've found a launching point for something good. Like they're planting something that could grow for years. Like their words are safe here.

Grove is not trying to be everything. It's trying to be *somewhere*.

A quiet corner. A place to be.
