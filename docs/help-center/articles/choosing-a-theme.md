# Choosing a Theme

Your blog should feel like yours. Grove's theme system gives you meaningful customization without requiring design expertise.

## Light, dark, or system

Every Grove blog supports three display modes:

**Light mode**: Clean, bright, easy to read in well-lit environments.

**Dark mode**: Easier on the eyes at night, uses less battery on OLED screens.

**System**: Automatically matches your visitor's device preference. If their phone is in dark mode, your blog appears in dark mode.

Most bloggers choose "System" to respect reader preferences. But if your content has a specific vibe (cozy late-night journaling, for instance), picking dark mode explicitly can reinforce that.

## Changing your theme

1. Go to **Admin** → **Settings**
2. In the **Typography** section, select your preferred font
3. In the **Accent Color** section, choose or customize your accent color
4. Click **Save Font Setting** or **Save Accent Color**

Changes apply immediately after saving—just refresh to see them site-wide.

## Curated themes (coming in Foliage)

Grove is building [[foliage|**Foliage**]], a full theme system with curated visual presets. Here's what's coming:

**First Buds** — The first 3 curated themes will be available to all paid plans. These hand-designed themes let you change your blog's overall look beyond just fonts and accent colors.

**Full Bloom** — The complete Foliage release will include all 10 curated themes plus the theme customizer for Oak and Evergreen plans. The theme customizer gives you full control over colors, typography pairings, and visual style.

For now, all paid plans have access to font selection and accent color customization.

## Fonts

All paid plans have access to Grove's complete collection of 10 carefully curated fonts—no upgrades needed. These fonts are chosen for readability, accessibility, and personality, and they work beautifully across devices and screen sizes.

**Available fonts include:**
- Accessibility fonts (optimized for low vision and dyslexic readers)
- Modern sans-serif options (clean and contemporary)
- Monospace fonts (perfect for technical or code-heavy blogs)
- Display fonts (add personality and character)

Each font is tested for readability, proper rendering across browsers, and accessibility. See the [[custom-fonts]] article for the complete list and details.

If you're unsure which to pick, Lexend (the default) is designed specifically for reading fluency and works well for most blogs.

**Custom font uploads:** When the Evergreen plan launches, it will include the ability to upload your own custom fonts. See the [[custom-fonts]] article for details.

## Accent colors

Every plan includes accent color customization. This color appears in:
- Links
- Buttons
- Highlighted elements
- Your blog's visual identity

Choose something that reflects your personality and works well with both light and dark modes.

## A note on design choices

Grove's themes are intentionally constrained. You can't make your blog look like a 1990s GeoCities page (sorry, or you're welcome, depending on your perspective).

This constraint is a feature. It means:
- Your blog will always be readable
- Mobile visitors get a good experience
- You spend time writing, not tweaking pixels
- Your content stays the focus

If you need pixel-perfect control over every element, Grove isn't trying to be that tool.

## Experimenting with customization

The settings page shows you what each font looks like and lets you pick colors with a visual preview. After saving, refresh your page to see the changes take effect across your blog.

Take your time experimenting—you can change fonts and colors whenever you like.

*Good design should be invisible. Pick a theme that feels right, then forget about it and write.*
