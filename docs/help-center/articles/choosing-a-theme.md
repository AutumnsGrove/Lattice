# Choosing a Theme

Your blog should feel like yours. Grove's theme system gives you meaningful customization without requiring design expertise.

## Light, dark, or system

Every Grove blog supports three display modes:

**Light mode** — Clean, bright, easy to read in well-lit environments.

**Dark mode** — Easier on the eyes at night, uses less battery on OLED screens.

**System** — Automatically matches your visitor's device preference. If their phone is in dark mode, your blog appears in dark mode.

Most bloggers choose "System" to respect reader preferences. But if your content has a specific vibe—cozy late-night journaling, for instance—picking dark mode explicitly can reinforce that.

## Changing your theme

1. Go to **Settings** → **Appearance**
2. Select your preferred mode
3. That's it—changes apply immediately

No save button. No page refresh. Just pick and go.

## Fonts

Grove includes a curated selection of fonts, chosen for readability and personality. What's available depends on your plan:

| Plan | Font Options |
|------|--------------|
| Seedling | 3 fonts + accent color |
| Sapling | 10 fonts + accent color |
| Oak | Full font library + theme customizer |
| Evergreen | Everything + custom font uploads |

The default fonts are designed to work well across devices and screen sizes. If you're unsure, the defaults are genuinely good choices.

### Available fonts include:

- **System fonts** — Fast-loading, familiar, accessible
- **Serif options** — For a more traditional, literary feel
- **Sans-serif options** — Clean and modern
- **Monospace** — For code-heavy or technical blogs

Each font is tested for:
- Readability at various sizes
- Proper rendering across browsers
- Accessibility (clear letterforms, good spacing)

## Accent colors

Every plan includes accent color customization. This color appears in:
- Links
- Buttons
- Highlighted elements
- Your blog's visual identity

Choose something that feels right. A warm coral, a forest green, a deep purple—whatever represents you.

See [Custom Accent Colors](/help/custom-accent-colors) for tips on choosing colors that work well.

## Theme customizer (Oak and above)

Oak and Evergreen plans unlock the full theme customizer, giving you control over:

- Header layout options
- Post list styling
- Spacing and typography scale
- Custom color combinations beyond the accent

This is for people who want more control without writing CSS. If you're happy with the defaults, you never need to touch it.

## A note on design choices

Grove's themes are intentionally constrained. You can't make your blog look like a 1990s GeoCities page (sorry, or you're welcome, depending on your perspective).

This constraint is a feature. It means:
- Your blog will always be readable
- Mobile visitors get a good experience
- You spend time writing, not tweaking pixels
- Your content stays the focus

If you need pixel-perfect control over every element, Grove isn't trying to be that tool.

## Preview before committing

When you change theme settings, the preview updates in real-time. What you see in the admin panel is exactly what visitors will see.

Take your time. Try different combinations. There's no penalty for experimenting.

*Good design should be invisible. Pick a theme that feels right, then forget about it and write.*
