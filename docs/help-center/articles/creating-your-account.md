# Creating Your Account

Getting started with Grove takes about a minute. Here's what to expect.

## How sign-up works

Grove offers three ways to sign in — pick whichever feels most comfortable:

1. **Google** — The quickest option. Sign in with your existing Google account, no new password needed.
2. **Magic link** — Enter your email, click the link we send you. No password, no third-party account required.
3. **Passkey** — Use your device's biometrics (fingerprint, face) or hardware key. The most secure option, no passwords or emails involved.

### Signing up with Google

1. Go to [grove.place](https://grove.place) and click **Get Started**
2. Click **Continue with Google**
3. Select your Google account (or sign in to Google if you aren't already)
4. You're in

### Signing up with a magic link

1. Go to [grove.place](https://grove.place) and click **Get Started**
2. Click **Sign in with Email**
3. Enter your email address
4. Check your inbox for a sign-in link (arrives within seconds)
5. Click the link — you're in

### Signing up with a passkey

1. Go to [grove.place](https://grove.place) and click **Get Started**
2. Click **Sign in with Passkey**
3. Your browser prompts you to use a fingerprint, face scan, or hardware key
4. Authenticate — you're in

> **Note:** Passkey support is still being refined. If you run into trouble, try Google or magic link instead.

## Why no passwords?

**No passwords to forget.** Every sign-in method avoids traditional passwords entirely. One less thing to manage.

**Better security.** Whether it's Google's two-factor authentication, a one-time magic link, or cryptographic passkeys — each method is more secure than a password you'd reuse across sites.

**Faster setup.** No "create a password, confirm the password, check your email to verify" dance. You're signed in immediately.

## What Grove gets when you sign in

When you sign in with Google, Google shares:

- Your email address
- Your name (as it appears on your Google account)
- Your profile picture (if you have one)

When you sign in with a magic link, Grove only gets your email address.

When you sign in with a passkey, Grove only gets a cryptographic identifier — no personal information at all.

In every case, Grove only receives the minimum information needed to identify you. We can't see your emails, files, contacts, or anything else.

## Choosing your blog address

After signing in for the first time, you'll choose your blog's URL:

```
yourusername.grove.place
```

Pick something you're happy with—this becomes your address on the web. Keep it short, memorable, and easy to type.

> **Note:** You can't change your blog address after creating it. Choose carefully.

## What happens next

Once your account is created:

- Your blog is live immediately, though empty
- You can access your admin panel at `yourblog.grove.place/admin`
- An optional tour walks you through the basics

From there, you can customize your blog's appearance, write your first post, or explore the settings. There's no rush.

## Signing in later

Coming back? Same process — use whichever method you signed up with:

1. Go to your blog's admin URL or grove.place
2. Click **Sign In**
3. Choose Google, magic link, or passkey

Grove remembers you for about 30 days. After that, you'll need to sign in again.

## Multiple sign-in methods

Your Grove account is tied to the email address or passkey you used to create it. If you signed up with Google, you can also add a passkey later from your account settings for a backup sign-in method.
