# Creating Your Account

Getting started with Grove takes about a minute. Here's what to expect.

## How sign-up works

Grove uses Google for authentication. No new password to create or remember. You sign in with your existing Google account.

1. Go to [grove.place](https://grove.place) and click **Get Started**
2. Click **Continue with Google**
3. Select your Google account (or sign in to Google if you aren't already)
4. You're in

That's the whole process. Grove creates your account automatically once you've authenticated.

## Why Google?

A few reasons:

**No passwords to forget.** You already know how to sign in to Google. That's one less thing to manage.

**Better security.** Google handles the security-sensitive parts—two-factor authentication, suspicious login detection, all of it. We don't store your password because there isn't one.

**Faster setup.** No email verification step, no "check your inbox" waiting. You're signed in immediately.

## What Grove gets from Google

When you sign in, Google shares:

- Your email address
- Your name (as it appears on your Google account)
- Your profile picture (if you have one)

That's it. Grove can't see your emails, files, contacts, or anything else in your Google account. We only get basic profile information needed to identify you.

## Choosing your blog address

After signing in for the first time, you'll choose your blog's URL:

```
yourusername.grove.place
```

Pick something you're happy with—this becomes your address on the web. Keep it short, memorable, and easy to type.

> **Note:** You can't change your blog address after creating it. Choose carefully.

## What happens next

Once your account is created:

- Your blog is live immediately, though empty
- You can access your admin panel at `yourblog.grove.place/admin`
- An optional tour walks you through the basics

From there, you can customize your blog's appearance, write your first post, or explore the settings. There's no rush.

## Signing in later

Coming back? Same process:

1. Go to your blog's admin URL or grove.place
2. Click **Sign In**
3. Choose your Google account

Grove remembers you for about 30 days. After that, you'll need to sign in again.

## If you have multiple Google accounts

Grove uses whichever Google account you select during sign-in. If you have several and accidentally pick the wrong one, sign out and try again with the correct account.

Your Grove account is tied to a specific Google account. You can't merge accounts or switch which Google account is connected.
