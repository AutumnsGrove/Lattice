# What is Weave?

Sometimes you need to show how things connect. Weave helps you do that.

Weave is Grove's visual composition studio—a node-graph editor for creating animations and diagrams. Built into Terrarium, it lets you draw connections between elements, configure timing, and watch relationships come alive. Motion that flows. Structure made visible.

## Why Weave exists

Many tools do animation. Many tools do diagrams. Most are either too complex for casual use or too simple for real work. And none of them feel like Grove.

Weave fills that gap. It's designed for writers and creators, not professional motion designers. Build a simple animation where elements respond to each other. Create a diagram showing how your project fits together. Export it to your blog without learning After Effects or Mermaid syntax.

## How it works

Weave has two modes:

### Breeze Mode (Animation)

Send a breeze through your scene and watch motion propagate.

Place nature assets on a grid—vines, rocks, trees, lattice elements. Draw connections between them (called "threads"). Configure how long motion takes to travel each thread, what easing to use, how delay builds up.

Then trigger the animation. The first element moves. That movement travels along threads to connected elements. Those elements move. The motion ripples through the whole scene like wind through leaves.

Perfect for:
- Decorative animations on your blog
- Subtle movement that makes scenes feel alive
- Chain reactions where elements respond to each other

### Trace Mode (Diagrams)

Map structure. Reveal relationships. Make someone understand.

Place glass cards with icons and labels. Connect them with threads showing relationships. Add labels explaining what each connection means.

The result is a beautiful diagram that fits Grove's visual aesthetic—dark mode friendly, glassmorphism-styled, nature-integrated.

Perfect for:
- Architecture diagrams
- Process flows
- Concept maps
- Anything traditionally done in Mermaid or Draw.io

**Note:** Weave is currently planned and will be built as an extension of Terrarium.

## What this means for you

**Animation without the learning curve.** No timeline editors, no keyframes, no export settings. Draw connections, configure timing, play.

**Diagrams that look good in dark mode.** Most diagramming tools export ugly white boxes. Weave's output fits naturally on any Grove blog.

**One tool, two uses.** Whether you need motion or structure, Weave handles both with the same interface.

**Part of your grove.** Weave outputs integrate directly with your blog. No third-party embeds or external dependencies.

*To weave is to interlace threads into fabric, to bring separate strands together into something whole. That's what you're doing here.*
