# What is Ivy?

Your Grove comes with an email address. Ivy is how you use it.

Ivy is Grove's zero-knowledge email client—a privacy-first way to manage your `@grove.place` inbox. Client-side encryption means we can't read your mail. Your words stay yours, even the ones you send privately.

## Why Ivy exists

Email is personal. But most email providers read your messages—for ads, for AI training, for reasons they don't always explain. Even providers that promise privacy often hold the keys that could unlock your messages if compelled.

Ivy takes a different approach. Encryption happens on your device before anything leaves it. Grove holds your encrypted messages, but we don't hold the keys. Technically, structurally, we *can't* read your mail.

This isn't privacy theater. It's privacy by architecture.

## How it works

Email access depends on your tier. Sapling ($12/mo) includes email forwarding to your `@grove.place` address. Oak ($25/mo) and Evergreen ($35/mo) get a full mailbox — send and receive. Ivy is the client for managing that inbox.

**Zero-knowledge architecture** — Your emails are encrypted with keys that only you control. We store encrypted blobs. Without your key, they're meaningless noise.

**Threaded conversations** — Emails are grouped into conversations, not scattered across your inbox. Follow a thread from start to finish.

**Rich text and attachments** — Full formatting support for reading and writing. Attach files up to your storage allocation.

**Blog integration** — Contact forms on your Grove blog route to your Ivy inbox automatically. Readers reach you, spam doesn't.

**Note:** Ivy is currently being built and will be available to Oak and Evergreen tier members.

## What this means for you

**Privacy that's real.** We can't read your email. Not "we promise not to," but "we literally cannot."

**Professional presence.** A `@grove.place` address looks better than a random Gmail on your about page.

**Everything in one place.** Your blog, your email, your domain—all part of the same grove.

**Contact forms that work.** When readers use your contact form, the message goes straight to Ivy. No third-party form services needed.
