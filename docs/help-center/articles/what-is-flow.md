# What is Flow?

Some thoughts come easily. Others need space to unfold. Flow is [[your-grove|Grove]]'s writing sanctuary—the Markdown editor where your blog posts and pages take shape.

When you click "New Post" in [[arbor|Arbor]], you enter Flow. It's more than a text box with formatting buttons. It's a space designed around one belief: **the best writing happens when the world fades away.**

## Why Flow exists

Most online editors fight for your attention. Toolbars demanding clicks. Sidebars showing unrelated information. Formatting menus that require a manual to understand.

Flow goes the other direction. Complexity hides until you need it. The toolbar appears only when you select text. Stats show in a quiet status bar. And when you want to disappear entirely into your writing, Zen mode removes everything but your words.

## How it works

Flow offers three ways to write:

**Write mode** shows your Markdown source with line numbers. Best for writers who know Markdown and want to see their syntax directly.

**Split mode** shows source on the left, rendered preview on the right. Best for learning Markdown or checking how your formatting looks.

**Preview mode** shows your post as readers will see it. Best for final review before publishing.

Switch between them instantly with `Cmd/Ctrl + 1`, `2`, or `3`.

### Zen Mode

Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter` and the world disappears. Full-screen. No sidebar. No distractions. Just you and the text.

Zen mode enables typewriter scrolling—your cursor stays centered in the viewport as you type, so your eyes never have to chase the bottom of the screen.

### Drafts that never disappear

Flow saves to your browser automatically as you type. Close the tab by accident, lose your internet connection, whatever happens—your words wait for you when you return.

### Fireside Mode

Some people freeze at a blank page. If that's you, Fireside might help.

Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F` and instead of facing an empty editor, you have a conversation. [[wisp|Wisp]] ([[your-grove|Grove]]'s writing assistant) asks what you're thinking about. You respond naturally. After a few exchanges, your words get organized into a draft you can edit.

Fireside doesn't write for you—it helps you find your words when they're stuck. Every post created this way includes a small marker so readers know you started with a conversation.

## What this means for you

**Write without losing work.** Auto-save protects your drafts. You can close your laptop mid-sentence and pick up exactly where you left off.

**Find your flow state.** Zen mode creates the conditions for deep focus. No notifications, no distractions, just the rhythm of your thoughts becoming text.

**Images, simplified.** Drag an image into the editor, or paste from your clipboard. Flow uploads it and inserts the Markdown for you.

**Your way of working.** Prefer raw Markdown? Write mode. Need to see formatting? Split mode. Ready to review? Preview mode. Flow adapts to how you think.

*Flow is the state every writer seeks—when hours pass like minutes, when the cursor moves as fast as thought. The editor is named for what it helps you find.*
