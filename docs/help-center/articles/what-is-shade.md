# What is Shade?

You write for people. Not for AI training datasets.

[[shade]] is Grove's content protection system—layered defenses against AI crawlers, scrapers, and automated data harvesting. It works in the background so you can focus on writing, knowing your words stay yours.

## Why Shade exists

Somewhere along the way, the internet changed. What was once a place for personal expression became a resource to be mined. Tech giants scrape websites to train AI models, often without permission, attribution, or compensation. Your blog posts become training data. Your voice gets absorbed into a statistical average.

Grove takes a different position: *not here*.

[[shade]] doesn't just put up a robots.txt and hope for the best. It implements eight layers of protection, from Cloudflare's native bot detection to behavioral analysis to legal notices. Determined scrapers face compounding difficulty. And when technical barriers aren't enough, legal standing is established.

## How it works

[[shade]] operates through multiple complementary layers:

**Layer 1: Native bot detection** — Cloudflare identifies known AI crawlers by their signatures and blocks them automatically.

**Layer 2: Firewall rules** — Custom rules catch scrapers that fake their identity or behave suspiciously.

**Layer 3: Rate limiting** — Bulk scraping patterns get detected and throttled. Real humans browsing at normal speed pass through unaffected.

**Layer 4: Behavioral analysis** — AI Labyrinth wastes scraper resources with meaningless responses while legitimate visitors get the real content.

**Layer 5: Verification challenges** — When behavior is ambiguous, Turnstile (Cloudflare's privacy-friendly CAPTCHA alternative) confirms the visitor is human.

**Layer 6: Legal notice** — Every Grove site includes a clear statement: this content is not licensed for AI training. Technical access does not constitute consent.

**And more** — [[shade]] continues evolving as scraper techniques do.

No single layer is foolproof. Together, they create protection that's actually meaningful.

## What this means for you

**Protection by default.** You don't have to configure anything. [[shade]] activates automatically on every Grove blog.

**Search engines still work.** [[shade]] protects against scrapers, not search. Google, Bing, and other legitimate search engines can still index your site so readers can find you.

**Your words, your ownership.** What you write belongs to you. Grove is a steward, not an owner. [[shade]] enforces that principle technically.

**Deletion means deletion.** When you delete a post, it's gone. [[shade]] helps ensure it doesn't persist in training datasets scraped before deletion.

*Shade is the cool relief beneath the canopy—protection from the harsh glare of exposure. In a forest full of harvesters, this grove stays shaded.*
