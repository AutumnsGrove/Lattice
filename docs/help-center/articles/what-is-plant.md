# What is Plant?

Every grove starts with a seed. Plant is where that seed goes into the ground.

Plant is Grove's onboarding system—the guided experience that takes you from "I want a blog" to "my blog is live." It handles signup, plan selection, payment, and a walkthrough of your new space. The whole journey takes minutes.

## Why Plant exists

Creating an account on most platforms means filling out forms, confirming emails, navigating confusing dashboards, and eventually figuring out how to do what you came to do.

Grove should feel different. When you decide to join, you shouldn't need a manual. Plant creates a welcoming path: clear steps, friendly guidance, no dead ends. By the time you're done, you know where everything is and you've already written (or started) your first post.

## How it works

Plant guides you through five steps:

**1. Signup** — Pick your display name and subdomain (that's `yourname.grove.place`). Choose an optional accent color if you want your blog to have a personality from the start.

**2. Verification** — Confirm your email address. This keeps accounts secure and ensures you can recover access if needed.

**3. Plan selection** — Choose the tier that fits you. Each plan shows what's included, with no pressure to pick the most expensive option. Seedling is a great starting point.

**4. Payment** — Quick and secure through our payment partner. No hassle, no surprises.

**5. Tour** — A brief walkthrough of your admin panel. Where to write posts, where to find settings, how things work. Skip it if you're confident, but most people appreciate the orientation.

Then you're handed off to your blog. The address is live. You can start writing immediately.

## What this means for you

**Ready in minutes.** From clicking "Get Started" to having a working blog: that's the timeline. No configuration marathons.

**A warm welcome.** Plant isn't a checkout funnel. It's designed to feel like someone showing you around, pointing out the good spots.

**You can always return.** The tour is available anytime from your dashboard if you need a refresher.

*A seedbed is where seeds are planted and nurtured until they're ready to grow. That's what Plant does for new Wanderers.*
