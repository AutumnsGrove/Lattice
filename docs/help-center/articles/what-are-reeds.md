# What are Reeds?

Every blog post invites a response. Reeds is how those responses happen.

Reeds is Grove's comment system—but not quite like the ones you've seen before. It offers two modes: private replies that only you see, and public comments that you moderate. Thoughtful engagement without the performance anxiety.

## Why Reeds exists

Public comments can be wonderful, but they can also be exhausting. Some readers want to share something personal. Some want to point out a typo without making a big deal of it. Some just want to say "this helped me" without performing appreciation for an audience.

Traditional comments make everything public. That pressure stops people from engaging at all.

Reeds offers a choice. Readers can send a private reply (only you see it) or a public comment (visible after you approve it). The result is more genuine engagement and less comment anxiety.

## How it works

Below each of your posts, readers see a simple form:

**Private replies** — Goes directly to you. No one else ever sees it. No moderation queue, no approval needed. Just a message from reader to writer.

Use cases:
- "Thanks for writing this"
- "I think there's a typo in paragraph 3"
- Personal responses they don't want public

**Public comments** — Submitted for your approval. Once you approve, it appears on the post for everyone to see. You control what becomes part of the public conversation.

Use cases:
- Adding to the discussion
- Asking questions others might have
- Sharing related experiences

Both types support threaded replies, so conversations can develop naturally.

**Note:** Reeds is currently planned and will launch alongside the comments feature.

## What this means for you

**More genuine engagement.** Private replies encourage responses from people who wouldn't comment publicly.

**You control the public conversation.** Nothing appears on your posts without your approval.

**Less spam, less noise.** Moderation happens before publication, not after.

**Simple for readers.** One form, one choice. No account creation required (though authenticated users get additional features).
