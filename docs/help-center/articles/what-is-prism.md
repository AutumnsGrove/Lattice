# What is Prism?

Light enters plain and emerges transformed.

Prism is Grove's design system—the visual language that makes every page feel like a place. Glassmorphism surfaces, seasonal theming, randomized forests, warm colors that work in dark mode too. It's why a Grove blog looks like it belongs in a grove.

## Why Prism exists

Design systems typically focus on consistency: making sure buttons look the same everywhere, colors match across pages, spacing follows a grid. That matters. But Grove needed something more.

Prism is designed for *feeling*, not just consistency. A Grove page should feel like stepping into a forest clearing. The design should evoke nature without being literal, feel warm without being saccharine, stay interesting without being distracting.

This is harder than making everything match. It requires principles, not just rules.

## How it works

Prism defines several core elements:

**Glassmorphism** — Semi-transparent surfaces that hint at depth. Content floats on glass that reveals background textures. Not the heavy frost-glass of iOS7, but something lighter—like looking through a greenhouse window.

**Seasonal theming** — Four seasons plus midnight: Spring (renewal, fresh greens), Summer (growth, vibrant warmth), Autumn (harvest, golden-orange), Winter (rest, cool neutrals), and Midnight (dreams, deep purples). Each shifts color palettes subtly while maintaining usability.

**Randomized forests** — The trees on landing pages aren't identical. Each forest generates procedurally: different heights, slightly different colors, varying positions. This creates life—no two page loads look exactly the same.

**Border radius language** — Grove uses consistent rounded corners that feel organic. Never sharp. Never circular. That sweet spot that feels hand-crafted.

**Typography** — A curated set of fonts that balance readability and personality. Different weights for hierarchy, but never overwhelming.

**Animation philosophy** — Subtle movement everywhere, but always respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`. Nothing demands attention. Everything breathes.

## What this means for you

**Consistent without being boring.** Every Grove property feels like part of the same world, but each has its own character.

**Dark mode that's actually warm.** Many dark modes feel cold or harsh. Prism's dark mode is "nature at night"—still warm, still inviting.

**Accessible by design.** WCAG AA compliant at minimum. Color choices are tested for contrast. Motion is optional.

**Your blog fits in.** When you customize your Grove blog with Foliage, your choices integrate with Prism's foundation. You can't make something ugly because the system gently guides good choices.

*A prism takes plain light and reveals the spectrum within. That's what good design does—transforms the ordinary into something that makes you pause.*
