# What is Clearing?

Sometimes things break. Servers hiccup. Maintenance happens. When it does, you should know about it—clearly and honestly.

Clearing is Grove's status page. Visit [status.grove.place](https://status.grove.place) to see whether everything's working, what's currently affected, and when things are expected to return to normal.

## Why Clearing exists

Nothing's more frustrating than not knowing if the problem is on your end or ours. Is your site down? Is Grove having issues? Is it your internet connection?

Clearing answers that question. When something goes wrong, you don't have to guess or contact support. Check the clearing, see the status, understand what's happening. It's transparent by design.

## How it works

The page shows the current health of Grove's major systems:

**System components** — Blog hosting, authentication, admin panel, CDN, email, and other services. Each shows whether it's operational, degraded, or experiencing an outage.

**Active incidents** — When something's wrong, you'll see a detailed explanation of what happened, what's affected, and what we're doing about it.

**Scheduled maintenance** — Sometimes we need to work on things. Planned maintenance is announced here in advance so you can plan around it.

**Incident history** — Past issues and how they were resolved. Transparency about problems builds trust over time.

The page updates in real-time. You can also subscribe to the RSS feed to get notified when something changes.

## What this means for you

**Never wonder if it's you or us.** If your site isn't loading, check the clearing. If our systems are operational, the issue might be local.

**Stay informed during incidents.** Updates are posted as we learn more. You'll know what's happening, not just that something's wrong.

**Plan around maintenance.** When we announce scheduled work, you can decide whether to write that important post before or after.

**No contact required.** During an incident, support gets overwhelmed. Clearing lets most people self-serve the answer to "is Grove down?"

*A clearing in the forest is where the trees part and you can see what's around you. That's what good status communication provides.*
