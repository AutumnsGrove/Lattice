# What is Greenhouse?

Not everything is ready for the open air. Some plants need protection while they grow.

Greenhouse is [[your-grove|Grove]]'s early access program—a space where features are tested before they launch to everyone. If your grove is in the greenhouse, you'll see things before they're official. You'll help us find bugs, give feedback, and shape how tools work before they're set in stone.

## Why Greenhouse exists

Launching features directly to everyone is risky. Bugs slip through. Design decisions that seemed good in isolation don't work in practice. Edge cases only appear when real people use the thing.

Greenhouse creates a buffer. Features come to a smaller group first. They get tested in real conditions but with lower stakes. Problems get caught before they affect everyone.

This isn't just about finding bugs. It's about listening. Greenhouse members give feedback that shapes how features evolve. The best ideas often come from the people actually using the tools.

## How it works

Greenhouse operates through the [[grafts|Grafts]] system. When a feature is in greenhouse testing, it gets grafted onto specific groves rather than rolled out universally.

**Who gets greenhouse access?** — A few ways:
- Higher subscription tiers often get automatic greenhouse access
- Some features are tested with specific user segments
- Occasionally we invite members who've given helpful feedback before

**What's the experience like?** — Features appear in your dashboard or editor before they're announced. Usually there's a small indicator noting "Greenhouse" so you know it's early access.

**Feedback matters.** — When you notice something that doesn't work right, or have an idea for how something could work better, let us know through [[porch|Porch]]. Greenhouse feedback gets special attention.

**Bugs happen.** — That's why it's called testing. Greenhouse features might be rough around the edges. If something breaks, it helps us fix it before the wider release.

## What this means for you

**Early access to new things.** If you're in the greenhouse, you experience features before anyone else.

**Your input shapes Grove.** Feedback from greenhouse testing directly influences how features ship.

**Expect imperfection.** Greenhouse features aren't finished products. Some things might change dramatically before official launch.

**Opt-out available.** If you'd rather wait for finished features, you can disable greenhouse access in your settings.

*A greenhouse shelters young plants from harsh conditions while they develop strength. That's what early testing does for features.*
