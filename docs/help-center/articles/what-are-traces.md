# What are Traces?

A trace is what remains when something passes through. In the forest, it's the impression of a hoof in soft earth, the path worn smooth by many feet. Evidence that someone was here.

In Grove, Traces are that small moment when a Wanderer says "this helped" or "this didn't."

## The short version

Traces are Grove's inline feedback component. You'll see them at the bottom of help articles, documentation pages, and anywhere else we want to hear from you. Two buttons: 👍 or 👎. That's it. You can add a few words if you want, but you don't have to.

Every trace travels back to the Wayfinder. Every voice matters.

## Why not just use a survey?

Surveys feel like homework. Forms feel corporate. Most people skip them because they're interruptions.

Traces are different. They're small, they're quick, and they stay where you are. You finished reading something. Was it helpful? Click and move on. You didn't have to navigate anywhere, fill out anything complex, or worry about whether your feedback was "important enough."

The friction is low enough that people actually use it.

## The three feedback systems

Grove has three ways to share your voice:

| System | Purpose | When to use it |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Feedback** | Anonymous thoughts | Open-ended ideas, longer reflections |
| **Porch** | Support conversations | Problems that need back-and-forth |
| **Trace** | Quick impressions | "Was this helpful?" moments |

Traces fill the gap. Feedback that's too quick for a form, too contextual for a dedicated page. Just a nod.

## What happens to your trace

When you leave a trace:

1. Your vote (👍 or 👎) and any comment get stored
2. The Wayfinder gets an email notification
3. Over time, traces reveal patterns

If many people leave 👎 on the same documentation page, that's a signal. Something's confusing. Something needs rewriting. Traces help us see where the paths are clear and where they need tending.

## Privacy

Traces don't require login. We hash your IP address for spam prevention, but we don't track who you are or link traces to accounts. You're just a Wanderer who walked through and left a mark.

The trace itself is small: your vote, your comment (if any), and where you were when you left it. That's all.

## Where you'll find them

Traces appear anywhere we want to hear from you:

- Bottom of help articles
- End of documentation pages
- Inside feature demonstrations
- After tutorials

They blend into the page. You'll see "Was this helpful?" with two buttons. Click, and you're done.

## Leaving a trace

Nothing to learn. If you see the prompt, click the button that matches how you feel. Want to say more? Expand the comment field and write a few words. Or don't. Both are helpful.
