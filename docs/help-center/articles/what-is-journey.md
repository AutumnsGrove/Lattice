# What is Journey?

Journey is a curio that lets you document your creative path—milestones, reflections, and the moments that shaped your work.

Think of it as a personal timeline, but warmer. Not a project management tool tracking deadlines, but a place to mark the moments that mattered. The day you finished your first draft. The week everything clicked. The quiet morning when you finally understood what you were building.

## How it works

Journey displays your milestones in a visual timeline:

**Milestones** — Mark significant moments with a title, date, and reflection. "Started the rewrite." "Found my voice." "Shipped v1."

**Reflections** — Each milestone can include a longer note. What did you learn? What changed? These reflections become a record of your growth.

**Visual timeline** — Your journey unfolds as a connected path, showing how far you've come. Past milestones glow softly; future ones wait ahead.

**Privacy controls** — Keep your journey private for personal reflection, or share it publicly so others can follow along.

## What this means for you

**Track your growth.** Creative work often feels invisible—you can't see how far you've come until you look back. Journey makes the progress tangible.

**Share your path.** If you build in public, Journey shows your audience the real story—not just the polished result, but the messy, meaningful process.

**Reflect with intention.** Writing milestones isn't just record-keeping. It's a practice of noticing what matters.
