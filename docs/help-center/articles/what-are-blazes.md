# What are Blazes?

Those small colorful badges you see on posts? Those are blazes — trail markers for your readers.

## What they do

A blaze is a visual marker that tells people what kind of post they're looking at before they even start reading. Think of it like a trail marker in the forest: a quick signal that says "this way leads to a food review" or "this is a personal thought."

Every [[blooms|bloom]] gets one automatically — a gentle "Bloom" badge that says "this is a piece of writing." But you can add a second blaze to give it more context. A tutorial. A project update. An announcement. Whatever fits.

## How they work

Blazes have two layers:

**The auto blaze** appears on every post. [[blooms|Blooms]] get a green "Bloom" badge. [[notes|Notes]] get an amber "Note" badge. You don't choose these — they happen naturally.

**The custom blaze** is yours to pick. When you write or edit a [[blooms|bloom]], you'll see a row of blaze options below the editor. Tap one and it attaches to your post. Tap it again to remove it.

Both show up side by side in your [[your-garden|garden]], in the feed, and wherever your posts appear.

## The defaults

Every grove comes with eight blazes ready to use:

- **Update** — for news and status posts
- **Food Review** — for the food lovers
- **Personal** — for the introspective ones
- **Tutorial** — for teaching moments
- **Project** — for build logs and project updates
- **Review** — for thoughts on things you've experienced
- **Thought** — for the quieter, reflective pieces
- **Announcement** — for the things that need a megaphone

## Custom blazes

Eight not enough? You can create up to 20 custom blazes in [[arbor|Arbor]] under **Settings → Blazes**. Each one gets:

- A **label** — what readers see ("Late Night Thoughts," "Recipe," "Book Notes")
- A **slug** — the URL-safe version, auto-generated from your label
- An **icon** — picked from a curated set of icons
- A **color** — choose from the palette or pick any color you want

Your custom blazes appear alongside the defaults in the editor picker, and they render the same way everywhere your posts show up.

## Where blazes appear

Blazes show up in:

- Your [[your-garden|garden]] listing — next to the date on each post card
- Individual [[blooms|bloom]] pages — in the metadata bar below the title
- The [[what-is-meadow|Meadow]] feed — on every post card and detail view
- Your [[arbor|Arbor]] post table — inline with tags
- RSS feeds — as structured data that other services can read
