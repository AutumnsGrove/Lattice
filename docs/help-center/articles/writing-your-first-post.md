# Writing Your First Post

Starting a blog can feel like standing in front of a blank page. Here's how to get past that and publish something.

## Getting to the editor

1. Sign in to your admin panel at `yourblog.grove.place/admin`
2. Click **Posts** in the sidebar
3. Click **New Post**

That's it. You're looking at the editor.

## The basics

Every post has a few parts:

- **Title**: What shows up at the top of your post and in your blog's post list
- **Content**: The actual writing (this is where you'll spend most of your time)
- **Slug**: The URL-friendly version of your title (auto-generated, but you can edit it)

You can also add:

- **Featured image**: Shows at the top of your post and in previews
- **Excerpt**: A short summary for your blog's listing page
- **Tags**: Help organize your posts (optional)

## Writing your content

Grove uses Markdown for formatting, but you don't need to know it. The editor has buttons for the common stuff:

- **Bold** and *italic*
- Headers
- Lists
- Links
- Images

If you just want to write paragraphs, you can ignore all of that. Plain text works fine.

Want to learn more? The toolbar has buttons for all common formatting options, so you can just explore as you write.

## Don't overthink it

Here's a secret: first posts don't need to be good. They need to exist.

Some ideas if you're stuck:

- **Introduce yourself.** Who are you? Why did you start this blog?
- **Share something you're thinking about.** What's been on your mind lately?
- **Post a photo.** Add a few sentences about it.
- **Write about something you learned recently.** Doesn't matter how small.

The post can be three paragraphs. It can be one sentence and a photo. There's no minimum length.

## Saving and publishing

While you're writing:

- **Draft**: Your post is saved but not visible to anyone. You can come back to it anytime.
- **Publish**: Your post goes live. Anyone with the link (or browsing your blog) can see it.

You can switch a published post back to draft if you change your mind. Nothing is permanent.

## After you publish

Your post is now live at `yourblog.grove.place/your-post-slug`.

A few things that happen automatically:

- It appears on your blog's homepage
- It's added to your RSS feed (so subscribers see it)
- If you've enabled Meadow, it may appear in the community feed

That's it. You're a blogger now.
