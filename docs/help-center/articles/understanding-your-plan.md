## What counts toward limits

### Post limits (Seedling and Sapling)

Every published post counts toward your limit. Drafts don't count until you publish them.

If you reach your limit:
- You can still edit existing posts
- You can still save drafts
- You can't publish new posts until you upgrade or delete old ones

### Storage limits

Storage is measured in bytes—the actual file sizes of your uploads.

**What counts:**
- Images you upload to posts
- Featured images
- Any media files

**What doesn't count:**
- Your post text (Markdown is tiny)
- Comments and replies
- Settings and configuration

If you reach your storage limit, you can't upload new images until you free up space or upgrade. Existing images aren't affected.

## Checking your usage

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → Account**
2. Look for the **Usage** section

You'll see:
- How many posts you've published vs. your limit
- How much storage you've used vs. your limit
- Your current plan and billing date

## What's included on every paid plan

Regardless of which plan you choose:

- **Markdown editor** with live preview and drag-drop images
- **Autosave** so you never lose drafts
- **RSS feed** for your blog
- **Meadow access** (opt-in community features)
- **Unlimited comments** on your posts
- **SSL/HTTPS** (secure connection)
- **Cloudflare CDN** (fast loading worldwide)
- **Daily backups** (your content is protected)
- **No ads** on your blog
- **No tracking** of your readers
- **Data export** anytime

## What happens if you exceed limits

**You won't lose content.** If you downgrade from Sapling to Seedling while having 100 posts, all 100 stay published. You just can't add new ones until you're under the limit.

**Same with storage.** Over the limit? Existing files stay. You just can't upload more.

Grove doesn't delete your content because you downgraded. We want you to stay because you want to, not because you're trapped.

## Centennial status (Sapling+)

After 12 cumulative months on Sapling, Oak, or Evergreen, your grove earns **Centennial status**. This means your site stays online for 100 years from the day you planted it.

- **Automatic:** No application needed. After 12 months, you're in.
- **Preserved even if you leave:** If you stop paying after earning Centennial, your site becomes a read-only archive. Your words stay online.
- **Opt-out available:** If you'd rather your site disappear when you leave, you can disable preservation in Settings.

A hundred years is roughly how long an oak tree lives. Some trees outlive the people who planted them.
