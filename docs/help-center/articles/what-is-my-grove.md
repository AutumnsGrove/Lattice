# What is my Grove?

Your grove is your space. Your corner of the forest. The place at `yourname.grove.place` that belongs to you.

## The short version

The platform is called Grove. Your personal space within it is *your* grove. When someone visits `autumn.grove.place`, they're visiting Autumn's grove. The possessive makes it personal. The word makes it home.

## Why "grove" instead of "blog"?

A grove is a small group of trees growing together. Intimate, sheltered, yours. It's not a feed. It's not content. It's a place where something is growing.

"Blog" feels clinical. Technical. Like infrastructure you're renting. A grove feels like somewhere you've planted roots. Somewhere that's actually yours.

## What's in your grove?

Your grove contains:

- **Your [garden](/knowledge/help/what-is-my-garden)** — where all your [blooms](/knowledge/help/what-are-blooms) (writing) live
- **Your pages** — static content like About or Contact
- **Your [foliage](/knowledge/help/what-is-foliage)** — how your grove looks (themes, colors, fonts)
- **Your [curios](/knowledge/help/what-are-curios)** — guestbooks, shrines, the delightful oddities that make a space feel lived-in

Everything at `yourname.grove.place` is part of your grove.

## The metaphor chain

Here's how Grove language fits together:

> You **wander** into the Grove → You **take root** → Your **tree** grows → Your **grove** flourishes → It **blooms**

The Grove (capital G) is the whole forest—the platform, the community, everything. Your grove (lowercase g) is your personal corner of it.

## Grove and accessibility

While "grove" appears throughout the interface, screen readers and search engines see "blog" or "personal site" in the underlying markup. The Grove language is what you see and feel. Standard terms remain for anyone who needs them.
