# What is my Grove?

Your [[your-grove|grove]] is your space. Your corner of the forest. The place at `yourname.grove.place` that belongs to you.

## The short version

The platform is called [[grove|Grove]]. Your personal space within it is *your* [[your-grove|grove]]. When someone visits `autumn.grove.place`, they're visiting Autumn's [[your-grove|grove]]. The possessive makes it personal. The word makes it home.

## Why "grove" instead of "blog"?

A [[grove|grove]] is a small group of trees growing together. Intimate, sheltered, yours. It's not a feed. It's not content. It's a place where something is growing.

"Blog" feels clinical. Technical. Like infrastructure you're renting. A [[grove|grove]] feels like somewhere you've planted roots. Somewhere that's actually yours.

## What's in your grove?

Your grove contains:

- **Your [[your-garden|garden]]** — where all your [[blooms]] (writing) live
- **Your pages** — static content like About or Contact
- **Your [[foliage]]** — how your grove looks (themes, colors, fonts)
- **Your [[curios]]** — guestbooks, shrines, the delightful oddities that make a space feel lived-in

Everything at `yourname.grove.place` is part of your grove.

## The metaphor chain

Here's how [[grove|Grove]] language fits together:

> You **wander** into the [[grove|Grove]] → You **take root** → Your **[[your-garden|garden]]** grows → You **plant [[blooms]]** → Your **[[your-grove|grove]]** flourishes

The [[grove|Grove]] (capital G) is the whole forest—the platform, the community, everything. Your [[your-grove|grove]] (lowercase g) is your personal corner of it.

## Grove and accessibility

While "[[grove|grove]]" appears throughout the interface, screen readers and search engines see "blog" or "personal site" in the underlying markup. The [[grove|Grove]] language is what you see and feel. Standard terms remain for anyone who needs them.
