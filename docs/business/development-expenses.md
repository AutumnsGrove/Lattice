| **Provider** | Anthropic PBC |
| **Current Tier** | $200/month (Max) |
| **Effective Date** | January 2026 |

### Usage Context

Claude Code is the primary development tool for the Grove project. Approximately 95% of total Claude usage is directly attributable to Grove development work, including:

- Code generation and review
- Architecture planning and documentation
- Bug fixing and debugging
- Feature implementation

| Prior months | Pro tier | $100 | Significant usage (~$500 worth of API equivalent) but not formally tracked |

### Write-off Calculation

Conservative business use estimate: **75-80%**

- At 80%: $200 × 0.80 = $160/month deductible
- At 75%: $200 × 0.75 = $150/month deductible

Actual usage is closer to 95% for Grove, but maintaining conservative estimate for tax purposes.
