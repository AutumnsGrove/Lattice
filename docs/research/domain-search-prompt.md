# Grove Domain Search - Comprehensive Research Mission

**Mission:** Find the perfect base domain for a multi-tenant blog platform where users get subdomains like `username.YOURDOMAIN.com`

**Context:** You have access to all Grove project documentation and research artifacts. Review them to understand the platform's vision, technical architecture, and business model before beginning the search.

---

## PROJECT ESSENCE (Quick Reference)

**What it is:** Multi-tenant blog platform on Cloudflare Pages with SvelteKit. Users get their own blogs on subdomains. Features a shared community "feed" where blogs can opt-in to share posts, vote, and react with emojis.

**Core metaphor:** A grove of trees - blogs are individual trees that grow together in a shared forest. When users share to the feed, they're creating a connected ecosystem.

**Vibe:** Druidic gathering place. Casual, organic, cozy, inviting. Light playfulness but with freedom. Easy to approach. Think: campfire circle in a forest clearing, not corporate boardroom.

## DOMAIN REQUIREMENTS (Non-Negotiable)

### **Format**
- ✅ **Single word only** (no compounds like "StoryGrove")
- ✅ **Easy to spell** (no ambiguous spellings like "Feyrie" vs "Faerie")
- ✅ **Easy to pronounce** (must be verbally shareable: "It's called X-dot-com")
- ✅ **Ideally 1-2 syllables** (3 max if exceptional)

### **Deal-Breakers (NEVER suggest these)**
- ❌ Hyphens (story-grove.com)
- ❌ Numbers (grove2.com, 2grove.com)
- ❌ Existing brand confusion (don't pick something that sounds like Squarespace, Notion, etc.)

### **TLD Flexibility**
- ✅ **.com** is ideal but NOT required
- ✅ **Alternative TLDs encouraged** IF they make sense and are memorable
  - Good: .blog, .space, .garden, .place, .community, .social
  - Consider: .site, .world, .zone, .earth
  - Avoid: .xyz, .io (overused in tech), .net (dated), .info (spammy feel)

### **Budget**
- **Target:** Under $20/year (unregistered domains)
- **Acceptable:** Up to $50/year if it's THE perfect name
- **Registrar:** Using Cloudflare's domain registrar

## CREATIVE DIRECTION

### **Theme: Nature (Broad Interpretation)**
The domain must evoke nature, but don't limit yourself to trees/forests. Consider:

**Ecosystem concepts:**
- Mycelium, fungal networks, roots, soil
- Meadow, glade, clearing, hollow
- Thicket, bower, dell, glen, copse

**Growth & life:**
- Sprout, seed, bloom, bud, fern
- Moss, lichen, fungi
- Sapling, seedling

**Natural gathering places:**
- Nest, den, burrow, hive
- Pool, spring, brook, creek
- Ridge, knoll, hill, vale

**Natural phenomena:**
- Dew, mist, rain, fog
- Ember, spark (forest gathering = campfire)
- Dawn, dusk, twilight

**Organisms & life:**
- Beetle, cricket, firefly (community insects)
- Moss, fern, clover
- Acorn, pinecone

### **Emotional Targets (Pick 2-3 per domain)**
Priority feelings:
1. **Cozy & inviting** (like a warm cabin)
2. **Community & gathering** (people coming together)
3. **Organic & natural** (not forced or corporate)

Secondary feelings:
- Light playfulness
- Freedom & openness
- Trustworthy & safe
- Creative & expressive

### **Target Audience Check**
When evaluating names, ask: "Would this appeal to..."
- ✅ Tech-savvy indie hackers (developers who blog)
- ✅ Creative/artistic folks (writers, photographers, artists)
- ✅ Professional bloggers (journalists, thought leaders)
- ✅ Everyone (accessible, not niche-exclusive)

## SEARCH STRATEGY

### **Phase 1: Brainstorm (Use subagents)**
Deploy subagents to generate 200+ nature-themed single words across these categories:

1. **Forest subagent:** Trees, woods, glades, clearings
2. **Water subagent:** Streams, springs, pools, mist
3. **Growth subagent:** Seeds, sprouts, blooms, fungi
4. **Creature subagent:** Birds, insects, small animals (communal)
5. **Gathering subagent:** Nests, dens, hives, burrows
6. **Phenomenon subagent:** Dawn, dusk, dew, ember
7. **Underground subagent:** Roots, mycelium, soil, burrow
8. **Poetic subagent:** Rare/beautiful nature words (glen, bower, vale)

### **Phase 2: Filter & Refine**
For each word generated:
1. ✅ Single word? (no compounds)
2. ✅ Easy to spell? (no ambiguous phonetics)
3. ✅ Easy to pronounce? (can say it out loud easily)
4. ✅ 1-3 syllables?
5. ✅ Evokes nature/gathering/growth?
6. ✅ Feels cozy/inviting/casual?

### **Phase 3: Availability Check**
For filtered candidates:

**Check .com first:**
- Use domain availability APIs or manual checks
- Note: "parked" domains (no active site) might be available for purchase

**If .com taken, check alternative TLDs:**
- .blog (perfect for blogging platform)
- .space (modern, community-oriented)
- .garden (nature-themed)
- .place (gathering place)
- .community (self-explanatory)
- .social (feed/community feature)
- .earth (nature-themed)
- .world (inclusive, everyone)

**Also check:**
- Is there an active business using this name? (trademark concern)
- Does it sound like an existing brand? (avoid confusion)
- Is the .com squatted or actively used? (context matters)

### **Phase 4: Price Check**
For available domains:
- Unregistered? → Note Cloudflare pricing (usually $8-15/year)
- Marketplace/parked? → Check asking price (acceptable up to $50)
- Premium pricing? → Note but flag as "over budget"

## DELIVERABLES

Provide a structured report with:

### **1. Top 10 Recommendations (Tiered)**

**Format for each:**
```
## [Domain Name]
- **Full domain:** name.tld
- **Pronunciation:** /phonetic/
- **Syllables:** X
- **Price:** $X/year (Cloudflare) OR $X (marketplace)
- **Status:** Available / Parked / Marketplace
- **TLD reasoning:** Why this TLD works for the brand
- **Nature connection:** How it relates to the theme
- **Emotional hit:** Which target feelings it evokes
- **Pros:** 
  - [strength 1]
  - [strength 2]
- **Cons:**
  - [weakness 1]
  - [weakness 2]
- **Target audience appeal:** [indie hackers/creatives/bloggers/everyone]
- **Availability link:** [where to check/buy]
```

**Tier structure:**
- **Tier 1: "Perfect Matches"** (3-5 domains) - Hit all criteria, available, under budget
- **Tier 2: "Strong Contenders"** (3-5 domains) - Minor compromises (maybe 3 syllables, or alternative TLD)
- **Tier 3: "Dark Horses"** (2-3 domains) - Unexpected/creative but worth considering

### **2. Full Candidate List**
- Alphabetical list of ALL checked domains with status (available/taken/parked)
- Note why each was considered or rejected

### **3. Trend Analysis**
What patterns did you notice?
- Which categories yielded the most available options?
- Which TLDs had best availability?
- Any surprising finds?

### **4. Naming Insights**
Based on the search, provide strategic advice:
- Are we being too restrictive? Should we consider compounds?
- Is .com availability so limited that we should lean into alternative TLDs?
- Any creative directions we haven't explored?

---

## SEARCH PRIORITIES (In Order)

1. **Availability** - If it's not available, nothing else matters
2. **Easy to spell/pronounce** - Verbal shareability is critical
3. **Nature theme fit** - Must connect to the organic/gathering/growth metaphor
4. **Emotional resonance** - Cozy, inviting, casual
5. **Price** - Under $20 ideal, up to $50 acceptable
6. **TLD appropriateness** - .com is great, but .blog/.garden/.space also work

---

## CREATIVE STARTING POINTS (Examples)

To give you inspiration (but don't limit yourself to these):

**Forest floor:**
- Moss, Fern, Clover, Lichen
- Mushroom (too long?), Fungi
- Mycel (short for mycelium?)

**Gathering places:**
- Nest, Burrow, Hollow, Dell
- Glen, Vale, Bower, Glade (check if available)

**Growth:**
- Sprout, Bud, Bloom, Shoot
- Root, Stem, Branch (single words from trees)

**Water:**
- Brook, Creek, Spring, Pool
- Dew, Mist

**Phenomena:**
- Ember, Spark
- Dawn, Dusk, Glow

**Creatures:**
- Wren, Finch, Lark (birds)
- Cricket, Firefly (one word: Firefly too long?)
- Bee, Moth

**Poetic/rare:**
- Thorp (Old English for village)
- Weald (Old English for woodland)
- Shaw (small wood or thicket)
- Holt (small wood or grove)

## FINAL NOTES

**Remember:**
- You have all Grove project docs - use them to understand the vision
- You have research artifacts - reference any domain insights already gathered
- Use subagents liberally - brainstorm broadly, filter ruthlessly
- Prioritize AVAILABILITY above all (beautiful name means nothing if taken)
- Think like someone hearing the name for the first time: "What's your site?" → "It's called [X]"

**Quality over quantity:**
- 10 excellent, available options > 100 mediocre, taken names
- Each recommendation should be something you'd genuinely use yourself

**Be creative but grounded:**
- Don't pick obscure words that require explanation (no "Quercus" - that's oak in Latin)
- But DO explore lesser-known nature terms (Glen, Bower, Dell are perfect)
