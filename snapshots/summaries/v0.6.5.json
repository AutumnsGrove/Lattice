  "summary": "This release brings the Grove logo tree into spring with pink blossoms, adds falling petals and dancing snowflakes to the forest, and unifies the vine background pattern across all sites. We also shipped the first version of the admin panel for email subscribers, wired up Stripe products, and added Turnstile human verification. Mostly polish, bug fixes, and laying groundwork for what’s next.\n",
