  "summary": "This week I added a data-driven Help Center to the knowledge base, gave the admin panel a subscription management UI, and taught Grove to encode images as JPEG XL. The monochrome logo option is there if you prefer it, and I cleared up a batch of test failures that were mostly about timezones.\n",
