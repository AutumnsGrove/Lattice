  "summary": "I finished moving the blog engine into its own npm package and set up publishing to GitHub Packages. I added a CDN uploader for your admin panel that uses Cloudflare R2, and wired up Stripe payments with an abstraction layer so you can swap providers later. The landing page now has a working email signup and an example site showing off all the engine features.\n",
