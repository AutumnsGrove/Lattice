  "summary": "Grove v0.4.0 merges the GroveUI library directly into the engine, which should make everything feel a bit more solid. The big fix is for the Markdown editor toolbar, which was freezing; that's now resolved. I also added a proper New Post page to the example site and cleaned up some SSR compatibility issues under the hood.\n",
