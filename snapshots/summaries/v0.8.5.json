  "summary": "This release adds a typography showcase to the vineyard, so you can see all the fonts in one place. I also cleaned up a lot of the color palettes and fixed the build errors that were popping up with Svelte 5. The manifesto page got a bit more personal voice and a link to the full vision, and I switched the OG image generator to a standalone Worker.\n",
