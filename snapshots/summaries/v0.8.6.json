  "summary": "This week I added a new Clearing status page, a Terrarium creative canvas to the workshop, and a three-column layout for the workshop on large screens. I also fixed a bunch of accessibility warnings from our audit and made subdomain links on the roadmap clickable. The rest was mostly documentation, adding ASCII art headers to specs and refining some diagrams.\n",
