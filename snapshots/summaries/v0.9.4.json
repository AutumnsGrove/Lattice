  "summary": "This week I added tier-based navigation page limits and a unified flowers palette, plus a new tree logo with a midnight mode easter egg. The release also centralizes all tier configuration into a single source of truth and fixes several rotation and color bugs across the interface. Most of the work was under the hood: isolating database queries, hardening security headers, and adding cache invalidation for blog posts.\n",
