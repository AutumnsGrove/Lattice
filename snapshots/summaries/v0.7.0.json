  "summary": "This release adds a self-service domain checker to Arbor, lets you change your username, and rebuilds the entire Glimpse suggestion system from the ground up. I also ported the Mycelium CLI to Go, added device verification for logins, and migrated several internal services to the new Infra SDK for better reliability. Under the hood, there's a new behavioral defense layer in Thorn and a proper framework for autonomous GroveAgents.\n",
