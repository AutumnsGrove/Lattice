  "summary": "This release adds a self-service domain checker, lets you change your username, and rebuilds the RSS feed with rate limiting. Under the hood, I migrated more services to the new Infra SDK, added an Onboarding Agent Durable Object for email sequences, and rebuilt all the command-line binaries for the latest changes. Also fixed a bunch of things, from Stripe webhooks to mobile layout quirks.\n",
