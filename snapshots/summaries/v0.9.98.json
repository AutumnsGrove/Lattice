  "summary": "Added passkey authentication, email magic links, and a fresh landing page with a feature carousel. Migrated all payments and tokens over to Stripe, unified our three competing auth systems, and fixed a bunch of bugs, including that infinite loop in the editor. The lexicon work is now fully integrated, so terms like Garden and Bloom should feel native across the site.\n",
