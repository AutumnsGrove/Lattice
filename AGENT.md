## Project Naming

| | |
|---|---|
| **Public name** | Lattice |
| **Internal codename** | GroveEngine |
| **npm package** | @autumnsgrove/groveengine |

Lattice is the core framework that powers the Grove ecosystem. The name evokes a framework that supports growth—vines climb it, gardens are built around it. Use "Lattice" in user-facing documentation and marketing; use "GroveEngine" for internal references, database names, and infrastructure.

## Project Purpose
Multi-tenant blog platform where users get their own blogs on subdomains (username.grove.place). Built on Cloudflare infrastructure with SvelteKit, featuring an optional community feed where blogs can share posts, vote, and react with emojis.

**The Why:** This isn't just a SaaS—it's about helping friends have their own space online, away from big tech algorithms. It's solarpunk-aligned (decentralized, community-owned), and built to be genuinely helpful rather than exploitative. Grove provides queer-friendly infrastructure: safe digital spaces, especially valuable when physical environments feel hostile.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** TypeScript, JavaScript
- **Framework:** SvelteKit 2.0+
- **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers, D1 (SQLite), KV, R2 Storage
- **Auth:** Heartwood (Google OAuth 2.0 + PKCE)
- **Payments:** Stripe
- **Email:** Resend
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Package Manager:** pnpm

## Architecture Notes
- Multi-tenant architecture with subdomain routing
- Cloudflare-first infrastructure (Workers, D1, KV, R2)
- Phase-based development: Lattice → Multi-tenant → Website → Meadow → Polish
- First client: Mom's publishing house

## Essential Instructions (Always Follow)

### Core Behavior
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files to creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested

### Naming Conventions
- **Directories**: Use CamelCase (e.g., `VideoProcessor`, `AudioTools`, `DataAnalysis`)
- **Date-based paths**: Use skewer-case with YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., `logs-2025-01-15`, `backup-2025-12-31`)
- **No spaces or underscores** in directory names (except date-based paths)

### TODO Management
- **Always check `TODOS.md` first** when starting a task or session
- **Check `COMPLETED.md`** for context on past decisions and implementation details
- **Update immediately** when tasks are completed, added, or changed
- **Move completed tasks** from `TODOS.md` to `COMPLETED.md` to keep the TODO list focused
- Keep both lists current and accurate

### Contributing
- **See `CONTRIBUTING.md`** for PR guidelines, commit conventions, and the AI agent section
- Keep Grove's warm, community-focused voice in documentation and user-facing text

### Git Workflow Essentials

**After completing major changes, you MUST commit your work.**

**Conventional Commits Format:**
```bash
<type>: <brief description>

<optional body>
```

**Common Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`

**Examples:**
```bash
feat: Add user authentication
fix: Correct timezone bug
docs: Update README
```

**For complete details:** See `AgentUsage/git_guide.md`

## Quick Reference

### Security Basics
- Store API keys in `secrets.json` (NEVER commit)
- Add `secrets.json` to `.gitignore` immediately
- Provide `secrets_template.json` for setup
- Use environment variables as fallbacks


### House Agents Quick Trigger
**When searching 20+ files**, use house-research for:
- Finding patterns across codebase
- Searching TODO/FIXME comments
- Locating API endpoints or functions
- Documentation searches

---

## Code Style Guidelines

### Function & Variable Naming
- Use meaningful, descriptive names
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities
- Add docstrings to functions and classes

### Error Handling
- Use try/except blocks gracefully
- Provide helpful error messages
- Never let errors fail silently

### File Organization
- Group related functionality into modules
- Use consistent import ordering:
  1. Standard library
  2. Third-party packages
  3. Local imports
- Keep configuration separate from logic

---

## Communication Style
- Be concise but thorough
- Explain reasoning for significant decisions
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Proactively suggest improvements when appropriate
