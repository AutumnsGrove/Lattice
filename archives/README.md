# Archives

Historical reference materials kept indefinitely for context and inspiration.

## Purpose

Unlike `_deprecated/` (temporary holding for code scheduled for deletion), this directory contains materials with lasting value:

- Design explorations and decisions
- Early project ideation
- Audit reports and analysis
- Useful prompts and templates

## Contents

| Directory/File | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `audit-reports/` | Security and code audit documentation |
| `design/` | Historical design explorations and decisions |
| `initial-ideation.md` | Original project vision and brainstorming |
| `project-backup-*.zip` | Point-in-time project snapshots |
| `prompts/` | Useful AI prompts and templates |

## When to Archive vs Deprecate

| Situation | Destination |
|-----------|-------------|
| Code being replaced | `_deprecated/` with expiration date |
| Design exploration we might revisit | `archives/design/` |
| Completed plan for reference | `docs/plans/completed/` |
| One-time audit or analysis | `archives/audit-reports/` |
| Old code no longer needed | Delete directly (use git history) |
