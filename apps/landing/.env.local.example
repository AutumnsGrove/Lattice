# Local Auth Testing with Cloudflare Tunnel
# Copy this file to .env.local and uncomment the line below
# to route auth requests through your local dev tunnel.
#
# Setup: See docs/plans/local-auth-testing-tunnel.md
#
# This overrides the production auth API URL (login.grove.place)
# so that auth flows go through the tunnel instead.

# VITE_AUTH_API_URL=https://dev.grove.place
