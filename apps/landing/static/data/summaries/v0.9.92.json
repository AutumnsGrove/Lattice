We've made significant improvements to text legibility in dark mode, refined our router (now named Passage), and completed our migration to Svelte 5 for a smoother, more modern foundation. This release focuses on enhancing user experience with clearer interfaces, stronger reliability, and more ways for you to share your thoughts with us.\n",
