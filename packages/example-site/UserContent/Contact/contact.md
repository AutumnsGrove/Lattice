# Visit The Midnight Bloom

## Location

**742 Twilight Lane**
Moonhaven, OR 97401

We're in the historic Starlight District, between the old clock tower and the river walk. Look for the brass moon on our door.

## Hours

**Wednesday - Sunday**
6:00 PM - 4:00 AM

*Closed Monday & Tuesday for rest and restocking*

## Getting Here

**By Car**: Street parking is available on Twilight Lane and adjacent streets. The meters don't run after 8 PM.

**By Transit**: The Route 11 "Night Owl" bus stops at Starlight & River, a 3-minute walk from our door.

**By Foot**: Follow the river walk north from downtown. When you see the old clock tower, turn left onto Twilight Lane.

## Contact

We don't have a phone—we find it disrupts the atmosphere. For inquiries about private events or wholesale tea orders, please email us:

**hello@midnightbloom.cafe**

We check our messages each evening before opening and will respond within 48 hours.

## Private Events

On Monday and Tuesday evenings (when we're normally closed), The Midnight Bloom is available for private gatherings of up to 12 guests. Perfect for:

- Small celebrations
- Book clubs
- Tea appreciation gatherings
- Quiet work sessions

Email us to inquire about availability and pricing.

## A Word of Welcome

Whether you're a night shift worker seeking respite, an artist chasing inspiration, or simply someone who can't sleep—you're welcome here. No judgment, no rush, just tea and the quiet company of fellow night dwellers.

*See you after dark.*
